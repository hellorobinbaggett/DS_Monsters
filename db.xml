Lydixavus is motivated by revenge. Each scar, each dent in their scales tells a story, and Lydixavus aims to return those gifts tenfold to those who bestowed them.</p>

					<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
					<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
					<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
					<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>
					<h>Indicator Species</h>
					<p>Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn&#8217;t take much to upset that balance. While toxins don&#8217;t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
					<h>Moisture Dependent</h>
					<p>Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>
					<h>Clawfish</h>
					<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.</p>
					<h>Angulotl Languages</h>
					<p>Most angulotls speak Filliaric.</p>
					<h>Wet</h>
					<p>Angulotls make use of a unique effect called &#8220;wet.&#8221; While wet, an angulotl doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.</p>
					<h>Angulotl Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any angulotl&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

					<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
					<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
					<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
					<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>
					<h>Indicator Species</h>
					<p>Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn&#8217;t take much to upset that balance. While toxins don&#8217;t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
					<h>Moisture Dependent</h>
					<p>Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>
					<h>Clawfish</h>
					<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.</p>
					<h>Angulotl Languages</h>
					<p>Most angulotls speak Filliaric.</p>
					<h>Wet</h>
					<p>Angulotls make use of a unique effect called &#8220;wet.&#8221; While wet, an angulotl doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.</p>
					<h>Angulotl Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any angulotl&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

					<h>ANIMALS</h>
					<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
					<h>Animal Traits</h>
					<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features.

					<h>ANIMALS</h>
					<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
					<h>Animal Traits</h>
					<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

					<h>ANIMALS</h>
					<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
					<h>Animal Traits</h>
					<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>
					<h>Mobility Traits</h>

					<h>ARIXX</h>
					<p>Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon&#8217;s peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal&#8212; sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.</p>
					<p>An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.</p>
					<h>Pastoral Pest</h>
					<p>Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate&#8212;unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.</p>
					<h>Terror of the Thaw</h>
					<p>Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.</p>
					<h>Arixx Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of an arixx&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>ANIMALS</h>
					<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
					<h>Animal Traits</h>
					<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

					<h>On Ajax</h>
					<p>He bestrides the land like one of history&#8217;s great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures&#8212;and no one to stand in his way.</p>
					<h>By Might and Merit</h>
					<p>Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital&#8217;s military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire&#8217;s conquests before them. Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis&#8212;an ancient flying sky-elf city&#8212;to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country&#8212;no one could ignore their might any longer.</p>
					<h>Treasures Abound</h>
					<p>Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person&#8217;s willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic. His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn&#8217;t prepared to handle.</p>
					<h>The Iron Saint</h>
					<p>While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn&#8217;t taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It&#8217;s up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.</p>
					<h>Ajax&#8217;s Languages</h>
					<p>Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.</p>
					<h>Tactical Stance</h>
					<p>At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:</p>
					<linklist>
						<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00009">Ability: Insurgent</link>
						<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00010">Ability: Mastermind</link>
						<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00011">Ability: Vanguard</link>
					</linklist>
					<h>Ajax's Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of Ajax&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>
					<linklist>
						<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00012">Ability: Reason</link>

					<h>ASHEN HOARDER</h>
					<p>Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders&#8212;hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.</p>
					<h>Appendages and Spikes</h>
					<p>Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct&#8217;s grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies. When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer&#8217;s door.</p>
					<h>Weaponized Bodies</h>
					<p>These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies&#8217; remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.</p>
					<h>Soul Shackle</h>
					<p>Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle&#8212; usually a ring or an amulet&#8212;that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder&#8217;s remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.</p>
					<h>Ashen Hoarder Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of an ashen hoarder&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>
