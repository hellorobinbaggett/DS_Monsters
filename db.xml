				<effect type="string">The shadow elves synthesize a concentrated pocket manifold reminiscent of Equinox and graft it onto the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, all creatures can see shadow elves in full color, and shadow elves no longer benefit from their Of the Umbra trait. Additionally, the potency of all shadow elf abilities increases by 2, and any enemy making a saving throw against an effect imposed by a shadow elf ability must roll an 8 or higher as they feel the effect across two worlds.</effect>

						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Lydixavus the Deadeye</h>
						<p>Nothing escapes Lydixavus (lee-DIX-uh-vas) or their unrivaled precision. After decades of careful training, they have honed their breath weapon into a swift and far-traveling bullet of ice. Lydixavus is motivated by revenge. Each scar, each dent in their scales tells a story, and Lydixavus aims to return those gifts tenfold to those who bestowed them.</p>
						<h>Draconian Languages</h>
						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.</p>
						<h>Draconian Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any draconian's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

						<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
						<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
						<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
						<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>
						<h>Indicator Species</h>
						<p>Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn&#8217;t take much to upset that balance. While toxins don&#8217;t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
						<h>Moisture Dependent</h>
						<p>Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>
						<h>Clawfish</h>
						<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.</p>
						<h>Angulotl Languages</h>
						<p>Most angulotls speak Filliaric.</p>
						<h>Wet</h>
						<p>Angulotls make use of a unique effect called &#8220;wet.&#8221; While wet, an angulotl doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.</p>

						<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
						<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
						<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
						<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>

Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
						<h>Moisture Dependent</h>

						<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs.

						<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
						<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
						<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
						<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>
						<h>Indicator Species</h>
						<p>Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn&#8217;t take much to upset that balance. While toxins don&#8217;t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
						<h>Moisture Dependent</h>
						<p>Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>
						<h>Clawfish</h>
						<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.</p>
						<h>Angulotl Languages</h>
						<p>Most angulotls speak Filliaric.</p>
						<h>Wet</h>
						<p>Angulotls make use of a unique effect called &#8220;wet.&#8221; While wet, an angulotl doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.</p>
						<h>Angulotl Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any angulotl&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

						<h>ARIXX</h>
						<p>Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon&#8217;s peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal&#8212; sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.</p>
						<p>An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.</p>
						<h>Pastoral Pest</h>
						<p>Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate&#8212;unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.</p>
						<h>Terror of the Thaw</h>
						<p>Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.</p>
						<h>Arixx Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an arixx&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

					<notes type="formattedtext">
						<h>On Ajax</h>
						<p>He bestrides the land like one of history&#8217;s great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures&#8212;and no one to stand in his way.</p>
						<h>By Might and Merit</h>
						<p>Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital&#8217;s military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire&#8217;s conquests before them. Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis&#8212;an ancient flying sky-elf city&#8212;to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country&#8212;no one could ignore their might any longer.</p>
						<h>Treasures Abound</h>
						<p>Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person&#8217;s willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic. His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn&#8217;t prepared to handle.</p>
						<h>The Iron Saint</h>
						<p>While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn&#8217;t taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It&#8217;s up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.</p>
						<h>Ajax&#8217;s Languages</h>
						<p>Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.</p>
						<h>Tactical Stance</h>
						<p>At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:</p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00009">Ability: Insurgent</link>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00010">Ability: Mastermind</link>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00011">Ability: Vanguard</link>
						</linklist>
						<h>Ajax's Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of Ajax&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00012">Ability: Reason</link>

						<h>ASHEN HOARDER</h>
						<p>Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders&#8212;hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.</p>
						<h>Appendages and Spikes</h>
						<p>Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct&#8217;s grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies. When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer&#8217;s door.</p>
						<h>Weaponized Bodies</h>
						<p>These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies&#8217; remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.</p>
						<h>Soul Shackle</h>
						<p>Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle&#8212; usually a ring or an amulet&#8212;that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder&#8217;s remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.</p>
						<h>Ashen Hoarder Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an ashen hoarder&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BASILISKS</h>
						<p>With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat&#8212;even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into an immobilized stone statue who remains thankfully unaware when the basilisk later consumes their petrified form at their leisure.</p>
						<h>Raising Young</h>
						<p>Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. By contrast, basilisk younglings can eat only petrified victims, and basilisks have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.</p>
						<h>Dangerous Servitors</h>
						<p>Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to hatch, raising and training basilisks as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone when a basilisk escapes and runs amok. Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas commonly keep basilisks as pets, owing to their own limited options for companionship. Both parties benefit from this relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.</p>
						<h>Alchemical Properties</h>
						<p>Alchemists have discovered a gland in the basilisk&#8217;s mouth that excretes an oil that reverts stone to flesh, making it easier to digest prey. If enough of the oil is collected, a salve can be created to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.</p>
						<h>Basilisk Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any basilisk&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BREDBEDDLE</h>
						<p>In their true forms, bredbeddles are ogre-sized headless giants. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passers-by and magically adopt their victims&#8217; forms. Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facade only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.</p>
						<h>Immortal Wanderers</h>
						<p>Bredbeddles don&#8217;t age, and if they are slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giant kind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giant kind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Tales tell of how their heads are kept for safekeeping in a fire giant&#8217;s cellar to be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior, which no bredbeddle has exhibited thus far.</p>
						<h>Green with Frenzy</h>
						<p>The longer a bredbeddle goes without a head, the more twisted and desperate their power grows. Their desire to be whole stretches out of their body in the form of shadowy dark-green ribbons, wrapping around and clinging to every surface they spill onto. Travelers warn one another of roads rumored to be haunted by &#8220;wild green knights,&#8221; often avoiding these routes for months. No journey is worth losing your head over.</p>
						<h>Bredbeddle Languages</h>
						<p>When a bredbeddle communicates, they typically use High Kuric or the languages that their head&#8217;s previous owner knew. A bredbeddle who has taken multiple heads over their lifetime most likely knows Caelian as well.</p>
						<h>Bredbeddle Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a bredbeddle&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BUGBEARS</h>
						<p>Bugbears are the bu&#8217;gath in the Khelt language, or &#8220;the bearers of the great fear.&#8221; Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps. Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.</p>
						<h>Thrown Into the Fray</h>
						<p>Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors&#8217; homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude. When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.</p>
						<h>Goblin Bond</h>
						<p>Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.</p>
						<h>Bu&#8217;gathic Magic</h>
						<p>Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu&#8217;gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands. Bugbear Languages Most bugbears speak Caelian, Khelt, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Bugbear Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any bugbear&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BUGBEARS</h>
						<p>Bugbears are the bu&#8217;gath in the Khelt language, or &#8220;the bearers of the great fear.&#8221; Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps. Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.</p>
						<h>Thrown Into the Fray</h>
						<p>Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors&#8217; homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude. When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.</p>
						<h>Goblin Bond</h>
						<p>Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.</p>
						<h>Bu&#8217;gathic Magic</h>
						<p>Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu&#8217;gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands.

						<h>CHIMERA</h>
						<p>Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in their throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor&#8212;but few know this creature&#8217;s origins as a divine guardian.</p>
						<h>The First Chimera</h>
						<p>The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian&#8212;one with a dragon&#8217;s cunning, a lion&#8217;s bravery, and a ram&#8217;s tenacity. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector not just for herself but also her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the beast. As a conquering force swept into the land, slaughtering the chimera was their fell goal. The queen&#8217;s resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras destroyed the opposing army, then dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.</p>
						<h>Tactical Warriors</h>
						<p>Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The three heads crying out together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.</p>
						<h>One Being, Three Heads</h>
						<p>Unlike some other multiheaded creatures, a chimera possesses a single unified mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera&#8217;s emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.</p>
						<h>Chimera Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a chimera&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 1+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>

						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 4+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>

The handmaiden always moves with and occupies the same space as the host and can’t be separated from them. While totally within the creature, the handmaiden doesn’t have line of effect to the host or targets outside the host and vice versa. \n\nAs a maneuver, the handmaiden can emerge from the host as a horrifying tower of flesh and bone that remains attached to the host’s insides. While emerged, the handmaiden can use a move action to make the host move up to their speed and has access to the host’s signature abilities, using the host’s modifiers for any power rolls. The handmaiden has the same Stability as the host. If the handmaiden or host is force moved, the other moves with them. While emerged, the handmaiden can be targeted independently of the host. The handmaiden can retreat totally within the host’s body as a maneuver. If the handmaiden dies, their remains separate from the host. \n\nThe Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes can be used to find a cure that removes a handmaiden from a host.

						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think.

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 10+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 10+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEVILS</h>
						<p>In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control&#8212;a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.</p>
						<h>Precarious Pyramids</h>
						<p>The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they&#8217;re always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.</p>
						<h>Silver Tongues</h>
						<p>Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil&#8217;s supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
						<h>True Names</h>
						<p>All devils have two names: one by which they&#8217;re commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them&#8212;or in stripping them of their power.</p>
						<h>Hell&#8217;s Defectors</h>
						<p>Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell&#8217;s bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.</p>
						<h>Devil Languages</h>
						<p>Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.</p>

						<h>DEVILS</h>
						<p>In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control&#8212;a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.</p>
						<h>Precarious Pyramids</h>
						<p>The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they&#8217;re always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.</p>
						<h>Silver Tongues</h>
						<p>Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil&#8217;s supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
						<h>True Names</h>
						<p>All devils have two names: one by which they&#8217;re commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them&#8212;or in stripping them of their power.</p>
						<h>Hell&#8217;s Defectors</h>
						<p>Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell&#8217;s bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.</p>
						<h>Devil Languages</h>
						<p>Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.</p>
						<h>Devil Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any devil&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DRACONIANS</h>
						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Aeolyxria the Uncanny</h>
						<p>From the moment she hatched, Aeolyxria (ay-oh-LIX-ree-ah) has enjoyed a fascination with the occult. She wanders the land, gathering strange tomes and artifacts to study. When she takes a job, it&#8217;s because she has a new doohickey she wants to test out. Aeolyxria possesses a sharp, tactical mind that lets her treat any battlefield as if it offered homefield advantage. If she could just get a handle on all her equipment, she&#8217;d be unstoppable!</p>

						<h>DRACONIANS</h>
						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Locratix the Morningstar</h>
						<p>A traveler from a faraway land and the sole progeny of her Dracogenesis clutch, Locratix (low-CRA-tics) focuses on survival over all other things. The very concept of the dragon knights is anathema to her, as there is no reason a wyrmwight should hand over the power that keeps them alive. Locratix travels widely while taking on mercenary jobs, but she is always just one better deal away from skewering her present employer on the end of her lance.</p>
						<h>Draconian Languages</h>
						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.</p>

						<h>Myxovidan the Sintaker</h>
						<p>Myxovidan (mix-OH-vih-din) was raised by a secluded order of monks who claimed his obsidian-black scales and nausea-inducing breath were an evil that must be purged. They subjected him to an austere lifestyle, full of intense training, meditation, and denial of worldly pleasures. But Myxovidan&#8217;s hunger would be satisfied, one way or another. When Myxovidan departed the order, he left behind a collection of emaciated monk corpses who looked as though they&#8217;d had the life sucked out of them.</p>

						<h>Phrrygalax the Subduer</h>
						<p>Phrrygalax (fuh-RIJ-ih-lax) was once a dragon knight in the service of Good King Omund. Though he took the oath to defend others against tyranny, he was always keenly aware he was created for violence. When the betrayal of the dragon knight Mandrake fractured the Dragon Phalanx that was the order of the dragon knights, Phrrygalax gleefully renounced his oath to follow what he believes to be his true, brutal purpose. Many who served with him believed he was merely waiting for a convenient excuse to do so.</p>

						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax.

						<h>DRACONIANS</h>
						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Dorzinuuth the Base</h>
						<p>To those who know the Dragon Phalanx of old, no name inspires more awe and fear than that of Dorzinuuth (dor-ZIN-yew-uth). A mastermind on the battlefield and the foundation of the dragon knights&#8217; fraternity, Dorzinuuth was known for mounting daring campaigns and always returning with the same number of soldiers&#8212; and often alongside new recruits. In the wake of the death of Good King Omund, many were shocked to see Dorzinuuth debase himself with banditry and petty mercenary jobs. Others hold on to the hope that he makes unknown moves in darkness, waiting for the day when he can again uphold his oath in the light.</p>
						<h>Draconian Languages</h>
						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.</p>
						<h>Draconian Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any draconian's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

						<h>Thorn Dragon</h>
						<p>Thorn dragons take root in the destitution of nature, and are cultivated by the suffering of those who struggle against the cruelty of drought, fire, flood, and more. Though a region&#8217;s people might have long overcome past famine, the desperation of those who suffered long before has already nurtured their future scourge. These dragons appear born of the wood, resembling living thickets bedecked in torturous thorns. With twisting briar horns and wings shaped by tangled roots, thorn dragons embody the richness of nature they so readily leech the life from.</p>
						<h>Conquerors of the Green</h>
						<p>Thorn dragons cultivate their lairs in lush farmlands or flourishing forests. They engulf these beautiful regions in massive briar thickets, choking out existing flora until their own brambles are the only things that grow. In forests, this process drives out local fauna smart enough to flee rather than foolishly fight against the wood&#8217;s new ruler. When a thorn dragon establishes their lair over a village&#8217;s farmlands, local folk either wisely relocate or slowly starve for the sake of stubborn pride.</p>
						<h>Natural Curators</h>
						<p>More intelligent dragons seek all forms of riches for their hoard, but thorn dragons have no eye for worldly treasures. Instead, they amass the wealth of the wild they represent. Thorn dragons stockpile food&#8212; even food they won&#8217;t eat&#8212;alongside uncut gemstones, minerals and ore, wood, oils, and spices.</p>
						<h>Bestial Instincts</h>
						<p>Compared to more powerful dragons, thorn dragons are closer to beasts in temperament. They are incapable of speech and act primarily on instinct as they expand their territories, defend their lairs, and grow their hoards. Despite this, the folk of certain settlements manage to avoid being driven from their homes or starved at the expense of being dependent on a thorn dragon&#8217;s bestial ego. These farmers and woods folk come to a tenuous understanding with the dragon, trading them the kinds of treasure they desire in exchange for meager foodstuffs from the dragon&#8217;s hoard.</p>
						<h>Territorial Brutes</h>
						<p>Thorn dragons are highly territorial, and are vigilant against potential threats to their lairs. To defend their homes, these dragons take advantage of their thickets by dragonsealing intruders, pushing and pulling them across the briars, and letting the thorns bleed them dry. When mere brambles aren&#8217;t enough, thorn dragons either imbue those brambles&#8217; barbs with poison or breathe out those toxins directly, taking pleasure in slowly draining the life from their enemies.</p>
						<h>Thorn Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>Features At the start of a thorn dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Gloom Dragon</h>
						<p>Where twilight spills long and cold over the lands and chilling fog hangs heavy and wet through long autumns and winters, there you will find gloom dragons. Wreathed in churning shadows and wrapped in glittering dark scales, gloom dragons bring with them heavy fog and mist that manifests hallucinations, trapping their prey in nightmares.</p>
						<h>Thrill of the Hunt</h>
						<p>While many dragons command grand enclosed spaces, gloom dragons make their lairs within sprawling, murky wilds, commanding vast territories. As clever as ravens and as cunning as hunting beasts, they use mimicry and hallucinations to draw unsuspecting travelers ever farther into the mists of their domain, until the fog swallows the sound of those travelers&#8217; screams. In areas where gloom dragons settle, people are known to have more nightmares than usual.</p>
						<h>Intangible Treasures</h>
						<p>Gloom dragons are eerie collectors of voices, memories, and nightmares, as well as material items. Though able to speak, they can only repeat exactly what they&#8217;ve already heard, and so they prize their vast collections of voices and phrases, using these sounds to lure mortals close enough to draw out their memories and fears. Endlessly curious and fascinated by terror, gloom dragons are keen to see what hallucinations terrorize their prey before they slaughter them. When a gloom dragon slays a victim, they take not just their valuables, but also whatever is most meaningful to their fears. A broken mirror from a dead lover will always fascinate a gloom dragon more than a perfect ruby brooch.</p>
						<h>Unnerving Neighbors</h>
						<p>Instinct and curiosity drive these enshrouded hunters. It is rare to find a gloom dragon who can be reasoned with, but some might develop an understanding with nearby settlements, such that each leaves the other to their business. Since gloom dragons focus on individual terrorizing over mass destruction, it is relatively easy to coexist with one lurking in the swamps nearby. But in such cases, these dragons become the subject of stories told to children, warning them to never follow voices into the fog.</p>
						<h>Gloom Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>Eerie myths surround the gloom dragons, for they wield languages they do not themselves speak. These draconic nightmares can mimic any sound they&#8217;ve heard. But more mysteriously, the magic that produces their hallucinations also mimics the sounds a foe&#8217;s mind produces, no matter their language. If a hero hallucinates a loved one dying, everyone around will hear that loved one&#8217;s screams for help.</p>
						<h>Gloom Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a gloom dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Crucible Dragon</h>
						<p>Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief&#8212;often the result of failure in the pursuit of perfection. Each dragon is a dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate. These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on how fastidious they are about cleaning, and are occasionally gilded with more-precious metals. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.</p>
						<h>Bastions of Steel</h>
						<p>Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in peaks cut through with thick veins of iron ore. Occasionally, one will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle, the first thing a crucible dragon sets in place is a colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, slagging that iron in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but a dragon keeps a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers.</p>
						<h>Discerning Collectors</h>
						<p>Crucible dragons are obsessive collectors, and have a habit of narrowly focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, the Rain of Ten Thousand Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Vasloria. Joris&#8217;nyrathi, the Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge. All crucible dragons manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than for melting down as filigree or embossing the weapons and armor they forge.</p>
						<h>Flawed Pursuits</h>
						<p>The failure that spawned a crucible dragon drives their obsessive pursuits. They endlessly attempt to reproduce the perfect treasures they count among their most prized possessions, but can only recreate flawed copies at a fraction of their original power. Discarded projects, melted heaps of raw iron, and scrap angrily embedded into cavern walls perpetually surround a crucible dragon as examples of their failures, perpetuating a cycle of obsessive rage, grief, and inescapable decline.</p>
						<h>Crucible Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>The oldest of crucible dragons are known to speak some Vastariax, though younger dragons are typically silent. However, survivors of an encounter with a younger crucible dragon sometimes report the monster using the Caelian phrases &#8220;not enough&#8221; and &#8220;mine.&#8221;</p>
						<h>Crucible Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a crucible dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Omen Dragon</h>
						<p>They have been known by many names: Reaper, Blight, Sorrow, Stillness, Vengeance, Grief. The omen dragons carry as many meanings and interpretations as death itself&#8212;for they are death embodied. This dragon is a coalescing of wayward souls, the stench of death solidified, that clings to the last vestiges of this world&#8212;to the detriment of their surroundings.</p>
						<h>Life and Death</h>
						<p>The opposite of life isn&#8217;t death&#8212;it&#8217;s stagnation. When a soul refuses to move on, it lives outside the cycle of life. Souls can have any number of reasons to linger: anger, fear, sadness, a thirst for revenge. One skilled at dealing with the undead might even be able to shepherd such a soul back into its cycle. But when hundreds of souls with hundreds of unique motivations bind themselves to an elemental and form an omen dragon, the only practical way to stop them is to destroy what they&#8217;ve become. As the embodiment of these wayward souls, the omen dragon wields them like weapons. They can send restless souls to grab creatures and pull them in, or to possess their attackers, compelling them to distraction in the middle of a fight. They even wrap themselves in the most durable of souls, creating a stifling aura.</p>
						<h>Life Outside Life</h>
						<p>Just as the omen dragon exists outside the cycle of life, so too does their domain. The omen dragon&#8217;s dragonseal brings desolation and stagnancy to all living things. Growth does not happen. Living things that grow or creatures who dwell near an omen dragon&#8217;s domain do not age. One can often find secret societies researching lichdom residing in such sites, for what better place to study than a stagnant wasteland that grants one infinite time? The effects that surround an omen dragon also mean that new life cannot begin. Civilization cannot exist, let alone prosper, without a reliable food source. When living creatures die in these dragons&#8217; domains, their bodies do not decompose. Their souls are sucked into the omen dragon, granting the creature ever more power.</p>
						<h>Wicked Visions</h>
						<p>To face off against an omen dragon is to stare down death itself. One can spend only so long near a choir of restless souls before being compelled to sing. For the sin of defiance, this dragon bestows upon their attackers an omen of their own death. Tarry too long near the creature, and a hero risks fulfilling that prophecy, even if they can weather the dragon&#8217;s unrelenting attacks.</p>
						<h>Omen Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>An omen dragon speaks with the voices of all the souls they have collected. In addition to Vastariax, the dragon speaks and understands whatever languages those souls knew in life.</p>
						<h>Omen Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an omen dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Meteor Dragon</h>
						<p>They dwell in the cold, airless depths of space in lair-cities built of stolen kingdoms for centuries at a time. Then without warning or mercy, a meteor dragon attacks.</p>
						<h>Kingdom Killers</h>
						<p>A meteor dragon&#8217;s territory is hard to define. Their attacks might come ages apart, and not every dead civilization or ruined city is the work of a dragon. But when a city grows too great, an empire too powerful, or a culture too advanced, the meteor dragon descends. Their violence isn&#8217;t mindless or wanton, but cold and calculated. Often, they breach dams, trigger landslides, and devastate granaries and fields, knowing that the chaos and devastation they unleash will continue long after they return to their lairs.</p>
						<h>Cities in the Sky</h>
						<p>Other dragons hoard trinkets and baubles. Meteor dragons claim their domain over infrastructure. Palaces, fortresses, monuments, and towers are often stolen by these creatures and brought back to their spacefaring lairs, arranged into dilapidated tableaus of the places they have obliterated. A meteor dragon&#8217;s floating lair-city is both their hoard and home, fused together and secured by the dragon&#8217;s glittering crystal dragonseal. Within this labyrinthine jumble of ruination, a meteor dragon lurks in wait for the next civilization to grow too comfortable.</p>
						<h>Avatar of the Infinite</h>
						<p>Meteor dragons have an innate mastery over gravitational forces that allows them to crush enemies and buildings on a whim. They&#8217;re among the smallest of the dragons, but the density of their bodies exudes an intense field of the cold, airless void of space around them wherever they go. A meteor dragon&#8217;s body is infused with crystalline starlight, which they can convert to a barrage of white-hot energy rays. At any distance, the dragon&#8217;s presence can forever sear the minds of lesser creatures.</p>
						<h>Voidlight Annihilation</h>
						<p>Voidlight is the name given to the unique energy produced by the breath of a meteor dragon. It is anathema to existence, an evil energy that destroys all. Anything that exists, no matter its material, strength, or potency, is inverted and ceases to exist when bathed in voidlight.</p>
						<h>Meteor Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>Meteor dragons are not known for their conversational habits. When they do deign to speak, it is exclusively in Vastariax and the First Language.</p>
						<h>Meteor Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a meteor dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering.

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELEMENTALS</h>
						<p>When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse&#8217;s most basic elements&#8212;air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.</p>
						<h>Duality of Form</h>
						<p>Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn&#8217;t suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew. Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.</p>
						<h>Rebirth and Reformation</h>
						<p>When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.</p>
						<h>Crux of Fire</h>
						<p>Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar&#8212;and if they don&#8217;t like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near. Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.</p>
						<h>Essence of Storms</h>
						<p>At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon. Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they&#8217;re usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.</p>
						<h>Essence of Tides</h>
						<p>An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters. Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship&#8212;but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.</p>
						<h>Field of Growth</h>
						<p>The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.</p>
						<h>Force of Earth</h>
						<p>A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.</p>
						<h>Elemental Languages</h>
						<p>Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.</p>
						<h>Elemental Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any elemental&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse&#8217;s most basic elements&#8212;air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.</p>
						<h>Duality of Form</h>
						<p>Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn&#8217;t suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew. Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.</p>
						<h>Rebirth and Reformation</h>
						<p>When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.</p>
						<h>Crux of Fire</h>
						<p>Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar&#8212;and if they don&#8217;t like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near. Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.</p>
						<h>Essence of Storms</h>
						<p>At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon. Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they&#8217;re usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.</p>
						<h>Essence of Tides</h>
						<p>An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters. Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship&#8212;but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.</p>
						<h>Field of Growth</h>
						<p>The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.</p>
						<h>Force of Earth</h>
						<p>A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.</p>
						<h>Elemental Languages</h>
						<p>Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.</p>
						<h>Elemental Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any elemental&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.</p>
						<h>High Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any high elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, HIGH</h>
						<p>The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>

						<h>ELVES, HIGH</h>
						<p>The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.</p>
						<h>High Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any high elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, HIGH</h>
						<p>The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.</p>
						<h>High Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any high elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>FOSSIL CRYPTIC</h>
						<p>The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought they were the fossilized reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers&#8217; priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren&#8217;t mindless undead&#8212;and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.</p>
						<h>Primal Sentries</h>
						<p>In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence, often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. Elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic&#8217;s domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the creature&#8217;s own form.</p>
						<h>Bones of the Earth</h>
						<p>Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling speed.</p>
						<h>Ancient Intelligence</h>
						<p>Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in ancient languages before attacking. Should trespassers persist, cryptics weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for battle.</p>
						<h>Fossil Cryptic Languages</h>
						<p>Many fossil cryptics speak Phorialtic, but they are known to also use the ancient languages of the ruins they inhabit.</p>
						<h>Fossil Cryptic Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a fossil cryptic&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GOBLINS</h>
						<p>Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning &#8220;more of us&#8221; in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.</p>
						<p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society&#8212;thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.</p>
						<h>Encountered in Groups</h>
						<p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident&#8212;perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they&#8217;re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.</p>
						<h>Mobile and Sneaky</h>
						<p>Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies&#8217; knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.</p>
						<h>Goblin Magic</h>
						<p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.</p>
						<h>Skitterling</h>
						<p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>
						<h>War Spider</h>
						<p>Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal&#8217;s back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.</p>
						<h>Worg</h>
						<p>Some goblins form a special bond with worgs&#8212;canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.</p>
						<h>Goblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Goblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any goblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GOBLINS</h>
						<p>Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning &#8220;more of us&#8221; in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.</p>
						<p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society&#8212;thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.</p>
						<h>Encountered in Groups</h>
						<p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident&#8212;perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they&#8217;re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.</p>
						<h>Mobile and Sneaky</h>
						<p>Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies&#8217; knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.</p>
						<h>Goblin Magic</h>
						<p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.</p>
						<h>Skitterling</h>
						<p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>
						<h>War Spider</h>
						<p>Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal&#8217;s back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.</p>
						<h>Worg</h>
						<p>Some goblins form a special bond with worgs&#8212;canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.</p>
						<h>Goblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Goblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any goblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GOBLINS</h>
						<p>Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning &#8220;more of us&#8221; in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.</p>
						<p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society&#8212;thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.</p>
						<h>Encountered in Groups</h>
						<p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident&#8212;perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they&#8217;re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.</p>
						<h>Mobile and Sneaky</h>
						<p>Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies&#8217; knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.</p>
						<h>Goblin Magic</h>
						<p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.</p>
						<h>Skitterling</h>
						<p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>
						<h>War Spider</h>
						<p>Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal&#8217;s back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.</p>
						<h>Worg</h>
						<p>Some goblins form a special bond with worgs&#8212;canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.</p>
						<h>Goblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Goblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any goblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GRIFFONS</h>
						<p>With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, griffons are the apex predator&#8217;s apex predator. Highly territorial with ranges spanning hundreds of leagues, these air-superiority hunters make quick work of any humanoids foolish enough to stumble into griffon lands.</p>
						<h>Coveted Mounts</h>
						<p>Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.</p>
						<p>Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.</p>
						<h>Inaccessible Aeries</h>
						<p>Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can&#8217;t fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for three months starting in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then remain in or near the nest as their parents feed them. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly&#8212;and after that, it&#8217;s only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.</p>
						<h>Rare Breeds</h>
						<p>Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety, a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety, and a striped condor griffon that combines the features of condor and tiger. Questions abound as to whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands, and many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can bring them evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.</p>

						<h>HAG</h>
						<p>When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal spellcaster, often a druid or a witch, they might forge a pact with an evil archfey. The mortal becomes a hag&#8212;aged, clawed, and cruel. A ruthlessly powerful fey in their own right, a hag uses their magic to bring about the misery their archfey wills.</p>
						<h>Hiding in Plain Sight</h>
						<p>Though hags typically appear as older humanoids, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. This theory has never been confirmed, however, as few who see a hag&#8217;s true form live to tell the tale.</p>
						<h>Dealmakers and Heartbreakers</h>
						<p>As old age can&#8217;t kill them, the oldest hags accumulate swathes of knowledge, magic, and repute over time. They are happy to share their wares &#8230; for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer&#8212;perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child&#8217;s laugh, or their left pinky toe.</p>
						<p>Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, with some getting so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.</p>
						<h>What&#8217;s in a Name?</h>
						<p>Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers such as Auntie, Uncle, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Uncle Twothumbs?</p>
						<h>Loyal Underlings</h>
						<p>Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they can trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.</p>
						<h>Hag Languages</h>
						<p>Most hags speak Anjali, Caelian, Khelt, and Yllyric, with older hags often knowing several more languages.</p>
						<h>Hag Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a hag&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>
						<h>Slaughter Demon</h>
						<p>When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack&#8217;tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.</p>
						<p>Devils captured the grack&#8217;tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any hobgoblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>
						<h>Slaughter Demon</h>
						<p>When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack&#8217;tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.</p>
						<p>Devils captured the grack&#8217;tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any hobgoblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>
						<h>Slaughter Demon</h>
						<p>When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack&#8217;tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.</p>
						<p>Devils captured the grack&#8217;tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any hobgoblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries.

						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>

						<h>HUMANS</h>
						<p>Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.</p>
						<h>Villains and Heroes</h>
						<p>Recognizing their limited lifespans, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes that their names will be remembered forever.</p>
						<p>Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more with might or magic. Others turn to theft, sometimes driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons both seeking to exact a toll.</p>
						<p>Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek fell power in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Human heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.</p>
						<h>Risks and Rewards</h>
						<p>Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive nature explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment&#8212;knowing when to risk all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent&#8217;s mistakes and seize the advantage.</p>
						<p>Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village, or an ancient dungeon yielding chests filled with coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it&#8217;s a game worth playing.</p>
						<h>Swords for Hire</h>
						<p>With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally &#8230; if you can afford their price.</p>
						<h>Connected to the Natural World</h>
						<p>Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that many other folk are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena have been created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural effects.</p>
						<h>Human Languages</h>
						<p>Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
						<h>Human Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any human&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HUMANS</h>
						<p>Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.</p>
						<h>Villains and Heroes</h>
						<p>Recognizing their limited lifespans, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes that their names will be remembered forever.</p>
						<p>Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more with might or magic. Others turn to theft, sometimes driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons both seeking to exact a toll.</p>
						<p>Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek fell power in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Human heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.</p>
						<h>Risks and Rewards</h>
						<p>Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive nature explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment&#8212;knowing when to risk all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent&#8217;s mistakes and seize the advantage.</p>
						<p>Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village, or an ancient dungeon yielding chests filled with coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it&#8217;s a game worth playing.</p>
						<h>Swords for Hire</h>
						<p>With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally &#8230; if you can afford their price.</p>
						<h>Connected to the Natural World</h>
						<p>Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that many other folk are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena have been created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural effects.</p>
						<h>Human Languages</h>
						<p>Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
						<h>Human Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any human&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KINGFISSURE WORM </h>
						<p>Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth. For when a worm senses the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their multiple serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into their cavernous maw. </p>
						<h>Intestine Inventory </h>
						<p>The kingfissure worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon&#8217;s hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have managed to claim the treasure lost to the inside of a kingfissure worm, but stories enough have spread to draw scavengers, bandits, and even armies to the corpses of recently slain worms, all hoping to come away with a king&#8217;s ransom in spoils. </p>
						<h>Home Renovators </h>
						<p>Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in that lair for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren&#8217;t disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food&#8212;occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm&#8217;s underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages. </p>
						<h>Unstoppable Force </h>
						<p>The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature. Though the monster might be slowed by a display of great power, only death stops them. Once they have set their sights on their prey, they single-mindedly pursue it regardless of terrain or circumstance. The only thing that gives a kingfissure worm pause are attacks on their tongues, which are left vulnerable when they are dragging creatures to their impending doom. </p>
						<h>Unclear Origins </h>
						<p>Kingfissure worms have no identifiable sexual characteristics and are extremely territorial. If two kingfissure worms encounter each other, the result is always a cataclysmic duel that ends in one devouring the other. Because of this, most scholars theorize that these creatures reproduce asexually&#8212;and that when a kingfissure worm dies, their tongues detach and grow into full-fledged worms. While this has yet to be confirmed, juvenile kingfissure worms have been seen in the wild, most often spotted following animal herds or traveling communities, feeding off of stragglers, refuse, remains, and vermin. </p>
						<h>Swallowed Survivors </h>
						<p>Kingfissure worms never stop growing, and the oldest are truly immense, easily mistaken in the distance for a strangely mobile mountain range. Deep within the bowels of these behemoths, unusual biomes and oversized gut fauna may flourish. In fact, some people who have survived their trip down the gargantuan gullet of one of the great worms have been able to eke out a life&#8212;and even form thriving communities&#8212;safe inside the spacious lower abdomen of their living quarters. </p>
						<h>Sensitive Giant </h>
						<p>For all their might and vitality, kingfissure worms are primarily ambush hunters, and like any ambush hunter, they need delicate and precise senses to detect and target their prey when it approaches. As burrowing creatures, they have a finely tuned sense of touch able to detect even the most minute vibrations while in direct contact with earth and stone. This fills the role of their primary sense, and their rudimentary eyesight leaves them dreadfully nearsighted. In combination, their poor vision and reliance on ground-conducted vibrations means that they have almost no way of pinpointing flying creatures, and many species of birds find kingfissure worm territory exceptionally safe and free from predators. </p>
						<h>Kingfissure Worm Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a kingfissure worm&#8217;s turn or when an action&#8217;s trigger occurs, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS </h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat. </p>
						<h>Defensive Masters </h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds. </p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before. </p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics </h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section). </p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons </h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations. </p>
						<h>Domain Expansion </h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory. </p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery </h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards. </p>
						<h>Cute Pets </h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side. </p>
						<h>Kobold Languages </h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian. </p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>Lightbenders can also bend the sounds they make, enabling them to almost completely disappear during a hunt.

						<p>Lizardfolk aren&#8217;t especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened&#8212;which it often is.

Lizardfolk cultures often focus on a specific trade, such as boat building, fletching, navigating, or weaving, and sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places. </p>
						<p>Adventurers often cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in abandoned ruins and caverns for protection. Treasure seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins. </p>
						<h>Focused and Loyal </h>
						<p>Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth. </p>
						<h>Marshland Tyrants </h>
						<p>In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing, and they often seek the aid of other folk who value freedom from tyranny. </p>

						<p>In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory.

						<h>MANTICORE </h>
						<p>A weary traveler hears a call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge&#8212;only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisonous spikes. In a manticore&#8217;s territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. Though manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh. </p>
						<h>Uncanny Appearances </h>
						<p>A manticore has a lion&#8217;s body, a dragon&#8217;s wings, and a scorpion&#8217;s tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common ancestries that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by devils inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they&#8217;ve heard&#8212;a talent manticores use to lure in prey. </p>
						<h>Heralds of Death </h>
						<p>Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet blast. This haunting sound unnerves and terrifies creatures, making them more susceptible to the manticore&#8217;s bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in. </p>
						<h>Ferocious Companions </h>
						<p>A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. Even after a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver. </p>
						<h>Manticore Languages </h>
						<p>Most manticores can mimic Caelian and one language commonly spoken in the region where they dwell. Except in rare cases, manticores don&#8217;t communicate in full sentences and are too driven by hunger to engage in negotiation. </p>
						<h>Manticore Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any manticore&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>MEDUSA </h>
						<p>Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, medusas are some of the most underestimated and misunderstood creatures. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god. But while some medusas embrace wickedness, many simply fight for their lives against those who threaten them through their ignorance. </p>
						<h>Cursed for Defiance </h>
						<p>When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, agents of that deity might curse them to live as a medusa. The offender&#8217;s skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone. </p>
						<p>Followers of the gods who imposes this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude, or to places haunted by creatures who don&#8217;t judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories. Many medusas plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of the aggressors who foolishly hunted or harmed them. </p>
						<h>Serpentine Reflexes </h>
						<p>While the medusa&#8217;s stone gaze is legendary, they can move, strike, and evade as swiftly as a snake, even briefly manifesting scaled wings to dart through the chaos. This enhanced dexterity makes them difficult to pin down. Their petrifying gaze allows them to attack at range as necessary, but they&#8217;re equally deadly in melee, where they have the full advantage of their snakes and the enervating venom pulsing through each snake&#8217;s set of needlelike fangs. </p>
						<h>Baleful Magic </h>
						<p>Medusas have many means to defend themselves, even aside from their petrifying stare. They slow enemies down, weaken them, and can even temporarily charm and control them once petrifying magic takes root in their veins. These reclusive beings are no stranger to being outnumbered and overwhelmed. All they have in their power to gain leverage over their opponents, they wield ruthlessly. </p>
						<h>Stone Gardens </h>
						<p>Medusas often reside in stone gardens filled with statues of those who previously tried to slay them. This not only allows them to slip between their statues, hide, and then strike, but it also allows them to command the battle while in their lairs, shattering statues to harm others. Evil medusas sometimes slowly reverse the petrification of their victims one limb at a time to feed on them, creating grotesque mausoleums of the crumbling dead for unwitting adventurers to wander into. </p>
						<h>Lifting the Curse </h>
						<p>Agents of the deity who ordered a medusa&#8217;s curse can sometimes be convinced to lift the punishment, usually in response to the medusa undertaking an impossible task in the god&#8217;s name or making a threat that can&#8217;t be ignored. Some sages claim that ancient rituals can undo the curse, but these lost secrets are often hidden by wrathful divine servants&#8212;and performing such a ritual might entail great sacrifice. </p>
						<h>Medusa Languages </h>
						<p>Medusas can speak any language they knew before they were cursed. Many of them speak Caelian, and others have learned the languages of monsters and creatures they dwell near. Additionally, tales tell of some medusas who speak the original form of Khamish. </p>
						<h>Medusa Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a medusa&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>MINOTAURS </h>
						<p>The fearsome minotaur is a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity. </p>
						<h>Primal Rage </h>
						<p>Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it. Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is impossible. </p>
						<h>Labyrinthine Origins </h>
						<p>The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia&#8217;s mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia&#8217;s anger&#8212;until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love. </p>
						<p>New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other labyrinthine terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, small numbers of minotaurs can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement. </p>
						<h>Deep Bonds </h>
						<p>Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature&#8217;s ire&#8212;but gods help them if they betray the minotaur. </p>
						<h>Minotaur Languages </h>
						<p>Most minotaurs speak their own dialect of Khamish.</p>
						<h>Minotaur Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any minotaur&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>MINOTAURS</h>
						<p>The fearsome minotaur is a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity.</p>
						<h>Primal Rage</h>
						<p>Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it. Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is impossible.</p>
						<h>Labyrinthine Origins</h>
						<p>The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia&#8217;s mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia&#8217;s anger&#8212;until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love.</p>
						<p>New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other labyrinthine terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, small numbers of minotaurs can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.</p>
						<h>Deep Bonds</h>
						<p>Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature&#8217;s ire&#8212;but gods help them if they betray the minotaur.</p>
						<h>Minotaur Languages</h>
						<p>Most minotaurs speak their own dialect of Khamish.</p>
						<h>Minotaur Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any minotaur&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>OGRES </h>
						<p>Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life. </p>
						<h>Extreme Emotions </h>
						<p>Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart&#8217;s desire, be it food, riches, or friendship. </p>
						<p>Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place. </p>
						<h>Savory Stories </h>
						<p>Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain&#8212;from deceptive mages to talking cats&#8212;swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences. </p>
						<h>Aristocracy of Bullies </h>
						<p>When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats&#8212;but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends. </p>
						<h>Cyclops: Ogre Progenitor </h>
						<p>Ogres originally descended from the cyclops, an old-world giant with a single eye whose kind still roam through remote canyons and valleys. These behemoths stand heads above the ogres and are twice as destructive once they&#8217;ve spotted their prey. But while their binocular cousins have gone on to become successful hunters and live for themselves, the cyclops is a scavenger hindered by their poor eyesight. Most cyclopses are eager to work for and defend powerful warlords or wealthy ogres, as long as they have easy access to food and shelter. </p>
						<p>Rumor has it that a cyclops can emit a mile-long energy ray from their eye. However, focusing such power is nearly impossible when their vision is usually too irritated and clouded by dirt. </p>

						<h>OGRES</h>
						<p>Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.</p>
						<h>Extreme Emotions</h>
						<p>Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart&#8217;s desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.</p>
						<p>Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.</p>
						<h>Savory Stories</h>
						<p>Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain&#8212;from deceptive mages to talking cats&#8212;swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs.

						<h>OLOTHEC </h>
						<p>Protean in form, beings of nearly pure intellect, the Old Ones think in alien geometric logic. Their name for themselves is unrecorded, but sages believe they are the oldest beings in the timescape and simply call them &#8220;The Old Ones.&#8221; Synlirii refer to them as olothec (OH- luhthek)&#8212;&#8220; ancient enemies.&#8221; But some humanoid scholars have noted this term bears an uncanny similarity to another archaic synlirii word meaning &#8220;ancient ancestor.&#8221; </p>
						<h>Immortal Evil </h>
						<p>Across countless cultures and ancestries, olothec feature in nightmares and temple friezes alike. While their origins are obscure and may never be known, their hatred of the mundane world and every living thing in it is well recorded. Olothec channel psionic energy beyond any mortal power, surpassing even the voiceless talkers. To them, a living creature who can&#8217;t reshape their own flesh is repugnant, an unnatural abomination requiring eradication&#8212;or transformation. </p>
						<h>Agents of Chaos </h>
						<p>Olothec consider the primordial chaos that spawned them as the ideal state of existence. They have long warred against the voiceless talkers, loathing their constant manipulation and refinement of evolutionary forces. Where olothec lair in forgotten sea tunnels and beneath ancient ruins, they surround themselves with slime servants&#8212;humanoids, beasts, horrors, and others, all devolved to a perfect physical and mental state. </p>
						<h>Primordial Form </h>
						<p>At first sight, an olothec seems like little more than a rippling mass of tentacles, twisting around each other like a shifting shroud. Creatures who get too close discover each of those tentacles ends in a ravenous mouth set with razor-sharp teeth. Each mouth is tipped by a cluster of three eyes that focus the olothec&#8217;s relentless attacks. In water or on land, fetid slime coats the horror, protecting them against attackers and acting as a conduit for their fearsome psionic power. </p>
						<h>Mutations of the Flesh </h>
						<p>Millennia of practice have allowed olothec to perfect psionic abilities that devolve and transform their victims into primordial life forms. Exposure to the psionic slime of an olothec&#8217;s tentacles can change a creature into a mindless, oozing thrall. The most powerful olothec have unique powers that further warp flesh. </p>
						<h>Olothec Languages </h>
						<p>Most olothec communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Urollialic. Many also know Old Variac and Caelian, but converse in those languages only when necessary. </p>
						<h>Olothec Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an olothec&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS </h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk. </p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings. </p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough </h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth. </p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively. </p>
						<h>Innate Power </h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit. </p>
						<h>Mohlers </h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet. </p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party. </p>
						<h>Scyzas </h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound. </p>
						<h>Orc Languages </h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak. </p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RADENWIGHTS</h>
					<p>The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as &#8220;meddles,&#8221; under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.</p>
					<p>When the radenwights&#8217; enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren&#8217;t above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.</p>
					<h>Bonds and Bravado</h>
					<p>It&#8217;s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community&#8212;as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it&#8217;s not one radenwight&#8217;s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.</p>
					<h>The Magic of Music</h>
					<p>The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon&#8212;even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.</p>
					<h>The Great Maclette</h>
					<p>The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without &#8220;The Great&#8221; before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.</p>
					<p>In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he&#8217;ll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Languages</h>

					<h>RADENWIGHTS</h>
					<p>The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as &#8220;meddles,&#8221; under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.</p>
					<p>When the radenwights&#8217; enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren&#8217;t above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.</p>
					<h>Bonds and Bravado</h>
					<p>It&#8217;s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community&#8212;as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it&#8217;s not one radenwight&#8217;s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.</p>
					<h>The Magic of Music</h>
					<p>The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon&#8212;even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.</p>
					<h>The Great Maclette</h>
					<p>The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without &#8220;The Great&#8221; before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.</p>
					<p>In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he&#8217;ll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Languages</h>
					<p>Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any radenwight&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RADENWIGHTS</h>
					<p>The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as &#8220;meddles,&#8221; under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.</p>
					<p>When the radenwights&#8217; enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren&#8217;t above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.</p>
					<h>Bonds and Bravado</h>
					<p>It&#8217;s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community&#8212;as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it&#8217;s not one radenwight&#8217;s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.</p>
					<h>The Magic of Music</h>
					<p>The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon&#8212;even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.</p>
					<h>The Great Maclette</h>
					<p>The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without &#8220;The Great&#8221; before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.</p>
					<p>In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he&#8217;ll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Languages</h>
					<p>Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any radenwight&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RADENWIGHTS</h>
					<p>The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as &#8220;meddles,&#8221; under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.</p>
					<p>When the radenwights&#8217; enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren&#8217;t above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.</p>
					<h>Bonds and Bravado</h>
					<p>It&#8217;s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community&#8212;as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it&#8217;s not one radenwight&#8217;s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.</p>
					<h>The Magic of Music</h>
					<p>The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon&#8212;even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.</p>
					<h>The Great Maclette</h>
					<p>The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without &#8220;The Great&#8221; before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.</p>
					<p>In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he&#8217;ll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Languages</h>
					<p>Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
					<h>Radenwight Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any radenwight&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>RIVALS</h>
					<p>They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town&#8217;s job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They&#8217;re rivals&#8212;heroes just like you. Maybe even better.</p>
					<p>Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in Draw Steel: Heroes&#8212;the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters&#8217; own heroic journey.</p>
					<h>Using Rivals in a Campaign</h>
					<p>These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class&#8217;s fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won&#8217;t be fumbling for a stat block. That&#8217;s what rivals are for.</p>
					<h>Rival Ancestries</h>
					<p>You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table pg 232, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.</p>
					<h>Rival Abilities</h>
					<p>Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in Draw Steel: Heroes), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival&#8217;s signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival&#8217;s level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.</p>
					<h>Rival Languages</h>
					<p>Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.</p>
					<h>Rival Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any rival&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>SHAMBLING MOUND</h>
					<p>Rich soil squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. But by the time a hapless explorer realizes the ground is moving, it&#8217;s too late&#8212;the shambling mound has devoured them.</p>
					<p>Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.</p>
					<h>Noxious Origins</h>
					<p>A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of nearby hags or mages, especially evil ones or those utilizing green magic. Latent magic seeps into the surrounding land, coalescing into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must grow, and that to grow they must feed&#8212;and thus they wander in search of a hunting ground.</p>
					<p>It is believed these magical origins are what give shambling mounds their ability to produce poisons, which vary from region to region. For example, the toxins from a shambling mound along coastal beaches or swamps might appear milky white and smell sweet like manchineel trees. Meanwhile, shambling mounds found in rainforests might give off a heady, intoxicating sweet scent at night, luring victims in with beautiful pale blooms like angel&#8217;s trumpets and producing intense hallucinations for those unfortunate enough to become poisoned. But while their specific effects might change, each shambling mound&#8217;s toxins typically have the same aim: enervate their foes and then magically absorb that lost strength and vitality.</p>
					<h>Hearty Eaters</h>
					<p>As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass. What is more satisfying, however, is when they find a shadowed, overgrown place to lurk until the meal comes to them&#8212;a veritable feast for little effort. After a mound engulfs their prey, be they animal or adventurer, the meal-to-be is sealed in a sack of interwoven vines and leaves. This vegetative hunter can then sap the strength of those within to feast or empower itself.</p>
					<h>Verdant Core and Expansive Sprawl</h>
					<p>When fighting a shambling mound, most attention is drawn to the cavernous chamber that holds their consumed victims. However, the shambling mound protects a smaller magic crux at their core with a knot of vines, leaves, and other natural defenses. The mound can expose this core to free up their form and become deadlier, thus opening themselves up to more potential harm.</p>
					<p>One must also be wary of the area around a shambling mound. Their vines reach out far, the full extent of their form hidden among other flora until they strike.</p>
					<h>Shambling Mound Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of a shambling mound&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>TIME RAIDERS</h>
					<p>Genetic rebels, the space punks known as the time raiders (called the kuran&#8217;zoi among themselves) scour the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, for heavily laden ships of any type.

					<h>TIME RAIDERS</h>
					<p>Genetic rebels, the space punks known as the time raiders (called the kuran&#8217;zoi among themselves) scour the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, for heavily laden ships of any type. But they prefer the ships of UNISOL and other empires, for they love raiding the frigates of powerful governments who think their money and imperious nature can buy security.</p>
					<h>Veterans of the Psychic Wars</h>
					<p>Thousands of years ago, the synlirii&#8212;those powerful and evil psionic horrors more commonly known as voiceless talkers&#8212;created the kuran&#8217;zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors&#8217; psionic potential, the kuran&#8217;zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.</p>
					<h>Hardened-Vision Hexapods</h>
					<p>Kuran&#8217;zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran&#8217;zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.</p>
					<p>Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran&#8217;zoi is like a squad unto themself.</p>
					<h>Psi-Tech</h>
					<p>Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran&#8217;zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.</p>
					<h>Genre Raiders</h>
					<p>The moniker &#8220;time raider&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer. Because they are pirates of the upper worlds, whenever a time raider hunting party arrives in Orden the locals assume these must be warriors from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.</p>
					<h>Leave a Few Alive</h>
					<p>Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran&#8217;zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: &#8220;Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they&#8217;ll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear.&#8221;</p>
					<h>Creatures Outside Time</h>
					<p>While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don&#8217;t age. As a result, many living kuran&#8217;zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.</p>
					<h>Time Raider Languages</h>
					<p>Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll. Because of the number of worlds they&#8217;ve visited, many time raiders have their speech peppered with misplaced tenses and strange references.</p>
					<h>Time Raider Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any time raider&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>TIME RAIDERS</h>
					<p>Genetic rebels, the space punks known as the time raiders (called the kuran&#8217;zoi among themselves) scour the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, for heavily laden ships of any type. But they prefer the ships of UNISOL and other empires, for they love raiding the frigates of powerful governments who think their money and imperious nature can buy security.</p>
					<h>Veterans of the Psychic Wars</h>
					<p>Thousands of years ago, the synlirii&#8212;those powerful and evil psionic horrors more commonly known as voiceless talkers&#8212;created the kuran&#8217;zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors&#8217; psionic potential, the kuran&#8217;zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.</p>
					<h>Hardened-Vision Hexapods</h>
					<p>Kuran&#8217;zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran&#8217;zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.</p>
					<p>Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran&#8217;zoi is like a squad unto themself.</p>
					<h>Psi-Tech</h>
					<p>Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran&#8217;zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.</p>
					<h>Genre Raiders</h>
					<p>The moniker &#8220;time raider&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer. Because they are pirates of the upper worlds, whenever a time raider hunting party arrives in Orden the locals assume these must be warriors from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.</p>
					<h>Leave a Few Alive</h>
					<p>Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran&#8217;zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: &#8220;Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they&#8217;ll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear.&#8221;</p>
					<h>Creatures Outside Time</h>
					<p>While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don&#8217;t age. As a result, many living kuran&#8217;zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.</p>
					<h>Time Raider Languages</h>
					<p>Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll. Because of the number of worlds they&#8217;ve visited, many time raiders have their speech peppered with misplaced tenses and strange references.</p>
					<h>Time Raider Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any time raider&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>TROLLS</h>
					<p>Ravenous trolls rampage through the wild to quell their fathomless hunger, leaving only destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, they have mottled green skin covered by a mane of matted hair that runs down their neck and back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison. A troll&#8217;s lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws that drag along the ground as they walk.</p>
					<h>Hypermetabolism</h>
					<p>A troll&#8217;s constant hunger and aggression beget a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.</p>
					<h>Phases of Destruction</h>
					<p>Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can&#8217;t be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this torpor and catch their quarry by surprise&#8212;though the cost of waiting can be high thanks to the damage a troll might do in the meantime.</p>
					<h>Strange Mutations</h>
					<p>Trolls prefer to prey upon humanoids and animals, but stories tell of them feeding on fetid demons and undead, assimilating those creatures&#8217; flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect. A troll with loose hanging skin, curling nails, or exposed bone might be in better health than their appearance would suggest.</p>
					<h>Limbjumbles</h>
					<p>When a suitably large piece of a troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Deep-seated survival instinct goes into overdrive, causing the detached piece to sprout unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Undead Malice Level 1+</h>
					<p>At the start of any undead&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Undead Malice Level 1+</h>
					<p>At the start of any undead&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts.

					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator.

					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie.

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires.

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Mummies</h>
					<p>Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature&#8217;s soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death. </p>
					<h>Vampire Spawn </h>
					<p>Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life&#8217;s essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims. </p>
					<p>Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire&#8217;s power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master&#8217;s orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires. </p>
					<h>Mournlings </h>
					<p>Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect. Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Mummies</h>
					<p>Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature&#8217;s soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death.</p>
					<h>Vampire Spawn</h>
					<p>Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life&#8217;s essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.</p>
					<p>Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire&#8217;s power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master&#8217;s orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.</p>
					<h>Mournlings</h>
					<p>Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect. Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.</p>
					<h>Undead Malice Level 4+</h>
					<p>At the start of any undead&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Mummies</h>
					<p>Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature&#8217;s soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death.</p>
					<h>Vampire Spawn</h>
					<p>Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life&#8217;s essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.</p>
					<p>Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire&#8217;s power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master&#8217;s orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.</p>
					<h>Mournlings</h>
					<p>Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect. Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Mummies</h>
					<p>Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature&#8217;s soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death.</p>
					<h>Vampire Spawn</h>
					<p>Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life&#8217;s essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.</p>
					<p>Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire&#8217;s power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master&#8217;s orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.</p>
					<h>Mournlings</h>
					<p>Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect. Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.</p>
					<h>Undead Malice Level 4+</h>
					<p>At the start of any undead&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Koptourok</h>
					<p>Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to &#8220;dead tourist.&#8221; It&#8217;s given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they&#8217;ve lost: breath.</p>
					<h>Haunt</h>
					<p>Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.</p>
					<h>Waxen</h>
					<p>When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process.</p>
					<h>Vampires and Vampire Lords</h>
					<p>By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals. The term &#8220;vampire lord&#8221; thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.</p>

Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Koptourok</h>
					<p>Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to &#8220;dead tourist.&#8221; It&#8217;s given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they&#8217;ve lost: breath.</p>
					<h>Haunt</h>
					<p>Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.</p>
					<h>Waxen</h>
					<p>When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process.</p>
					<h>Vampires and Vampire Lords</h>
					<p>By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals. The term &#8220;vampire lord&#8221; thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Koptourok</h>
					<p>Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to &#8220;dead tourist.&#8221; It&#8217;s given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they&#8217;ve lost: breath.</p>
					<h>Haunt</h>
					<p>Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.</p>
					<h>Waxen</h>
					<p>When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process.</p>
					<h>Vampires and Vampire Lords</h>
					<p>By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals. The term &#8220;vampire lord&#8221; thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.</p>

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Koptourok</h>
					<p>Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to &#8220;dead tourist.&#8221; It&#8217;s given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they&#8217;ve lost: breath.</p>
					<h>Haunt</h>
					<p>Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.</p>
					<h>Waxen</h>
					<p>When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process.</p>
					<h>Vampires and Vampire Lords</h>
					<p>By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals. The term &#8220;vampire lord&#8221; thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.</p>
					<h>Undead Malice Level 7+</h>
					<p>At the start of any undead&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Undead&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Koptourok</h>
					<p>Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to &#8220;dead tourist.&#8221; It&#8217;s given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they&#8217;ve lost: breath.</p>
					<h>Haunt</h>
					<p>Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.</p>
					<h>Waxen</h>
					<p>When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process.</p>
					<h>Vampires and Vampire Lords</h>
					<p>By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals. The term &#8220;vampire lord&#8221; thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.</p>

					<h>Undead&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>The deadliest of undead creatures can be placed into one of two categories: terrible machines that know only destruction, and powerful tyrants who aren&#8217;t content with conquering just death.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes.

					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms.

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>The deadliest of undead creatures can be placed into one of two categories: terrible machines that know only destruction, and powerful tyrants who aren&#8217;t content with conquering just death.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires.

					<h>UNDEAD</h>
					<p>Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.</p>
					<p>Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people&#8217;s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.</p>
					<h>Undead&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>The deadliest of undead creatures can be placed into one of two categories: terrible machines that know only destruction, and powerful tyrants who aren&#8217;t content with conquering just death.</p>
					<h>Dark Places</h>
					<p>For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun&#8217;s golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.</p>
					<h>Encountered Together</h>
					<p>Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don&#8217;t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.</p>
					<h>Corporeal Undead</h>
					<p>At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can&#8217;t think beyond the orders of their creators&#8212;unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren&#8217;t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.</p>
					<h>Spectral Undead</h>
					<p>Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person&#8217;s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer&#8217;s fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.</p>
					<p>Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.</p>
					<h>Undead Languages</h>
					<p>Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life. Undead&#8212;1st Echelon It&#8217;s rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
					<h>Bonecage</h>
					<p>The weakness of many undead minions means that necromancers at war often find themselves shy of corpses when their forces lose more numbers than they slay. The bonecage offers a horrific solution to this problem. This hulking creature made from giants&#8217; bones is structured like a massive cage that they can cram dead and near-dead corpses into. Trawling the scenes of great battles, the bonecage fills themself with the fallen, stealing them away for ill purposes. Of course, when no mass casualty site presents itself, the bonecage is more than capable of making corpses of their own.</p>
					<h>Lithgekh</h>
					<p>Every mage who lives long enough eventually contends with the fact that their knowledge will one day leave the world. For those who can&#8217;t stomach this idea, seeking the immortality of the lich often becomes an irresistible temptation. But many of those who try and fail to achieve lichdom become lithgekh&#8212;a word in the First Language meaning &#8220;lich corpse.&#8221; Having failed to create a proper soul vessel, a lithgekh suffers an eternal hunger for magic to sustain themself. Liches will sometimes trick or tempt mortal mages into pursuing lichdom, only to sabotage them and create a lithgekh under the lich&#8217;s control. These servants are prized by liches for their ability to disrupt enemy magic and empower their own.</p>

					<h>Count Rhodar Von Glauer</h>
					<p>After falling to a vampiric curse in his early twenties, Count Rhodar&#8212; the last Lord of Glauer&#8212;ruled his tiny, heavily forested mountainous county in eastern Rh&#246;l for three hundred years. There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.</p>
					<p>Each new moon, when the Red Tax came due, the count would visit a young candidate, then emerge with renewed vitality. Across the land, folk feared their Dragon Count, but the witches of the wood wove a prophecy: &#8220;The land&#8217;s darkest hour shall be the redemption of House von Glauer.&#8221;</p>
					<p>Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar&#8212;not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.</p>
					<p>Under new rule, Rhodar&#8217;s people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches&#8217; whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believ&#172;ing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny.</p>
					<h>Excerpt from the Chronicle of the Chain of Acheron</h>
					<p>&#8220;In those days the Chain was in service to the Emperor Gaius VIII, third of the Five Crusading Emperors, and 27th Emperor of Caelia. Gaius continued the crusades started by his illustrious granduncle. Those were profitable days for the Chain, the Wheel, and the Gate. While the other Helltroopers waded into the deserts of Khoursir and Khemhara, we battled in the forests of Vaslor. We had it easy. I hate deserts.</p>
					<p>&#8220;Thinking his vampiric power would save him, Count Rhodar von Glauer waited until he was fulsome in his strength before trying to extend his dark realm into Caelian territory. But we know how to deal with vampires. The black and gold standard of the von Glauer family reads, &#8220;I do the devil&#8217;s work.&#8221; We can attest to that. We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, &#8220;He is the land!&#8221; but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds. Finger had to drop it in one of his bottomless sacks to stop the mists from coming. What the emperor will do with it, I don&#8217;t know. I fear that staff may hold more than the power to make the mist.&#8221;</p>

					<h>A Lordly Beast</h>
					<p>In spite of the fact that he literally preyed upon them (though only one a month!) the people of Glauer seemed to take great pride in their immortal count. Many historical sources record Von Glauer&#8217;s noble bearing. He took his role as protector and defender of the people and their well-being seriously, in keeping with the traditions of classical nobility. Invited guests must be treated with decency, insults demand apology or satisfaction. Debts must be repaid, treaties honored.</p>
					<p>Those who violated the law or threatened his people met a very different Count. It was said he stalked his enemies in the guise of a great wolf, or wing&#233;d gangrenous beast.</p>
					<p>In his humanoid form he treated guests, even enemy commanders with honor and dignity. What his demeanor might be should he return is unknown.</p>
					<h>The Darkest Hour</h>
					<p>It&#8217;s been over a thousand years since The Chain of Acheron staked Von Glauer, but the wise women of Rh&#246;l speak as though the Dragon Count is merely on vacation. Ajax killed the Earl of Rh&#246;l during his conquest of Vasloria but has yet to dispatch anyone to rule in their stead.</p>
					<p>For people of Glauer, the wise women&#8217;s prophesy feels close. They sense the import of the times in which they live, and expect Ajax or one of his lieutenants to return to rule with an iron fist. The people speak openly now of their Dragon Count returning to defend them against this possibility.</p>
					<p>How his return might be possible is not clear, but it would surely involve the Rod of Count Rhodar Von Glauer, currently held under the city of Capital in the Great Reliquary of the Last Emperor, also known as Ringwell.</p>
					<h>Count Rhodar&#8217;s Languages</h>
					<p>Rhodar speaks Caelian and Vaslorian.</p>
					<h>Rhodar&#8217;s Malice </h>
					<p>At the start of Rhodar&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>LICH</h>
					<p>A lich begins life as a mortal, often a studied mage, fueled by a burning, unquenchable hunger for knowledge at any cost. Knowledge beyond life and death, beyond this world, beyond gods and fiends. Possessed by the unshakable belief that ultimate knowledge brings ultimate power. The necessary rites are forbidden in many cultures, for they require a bloody, evil act: the sacrifice of someone dear to the would-be lich.</p>
					<h>Forging a Soulstone</h>
					<p>The ritual to create a lich requires a sphere constructed of something personal to the subject, such as steel from an heirloom suit of armor or a tangle of branches from the tree that shaded their wedding. To complete the rite, the subject must rip out their own heart and the heart of a living loved one, placing both inside the sphere. The hearts conjoin and transmute into a ruby that welds to the sphere, creating the new lich&#8217;s soulstone. As long as their soulstone remains intact, a lich can never truly die. Most soulstones are small and easy to conceal, though a lich can construct the stone&#8217;s outer sphere to be any size that suits their purpose.</p>
					<h>Terrifying Immortality</h>
					<p>A lich&#8217;s true appearance is ghastly. The damage to their chest never heals, and over the centuries, their body slowly decays into a skeleton. Some liches hide their appearance with an illusion that makes them even more attractive and vivacious than they were in life. Others embrace their terrifying look, proudly displaying their fell triumph to every creature they encounter.</p>
					<p>Though all liches desire eternal life, it fails to satisfy most. Liches who were once powerful adventurers seek more of everything they&#8217;ve always craved&#8212;more glory, more power, more wealth. Most set about amassing all three, building armies of followers to seize whatever the lich desires from any who resist their power.</p>
					<h>Eldritch Lairs</h>
					<p>Liches are strongest when surrounded by devoted followers. Although they are often encountered alone, most liches have legions of undead, mind-warped cultists, or amoral mercenary companies guarding their most important holdings. Their lairs can be found inside strongholds and castles, hidden in bank vaults or government halls, or ensconced in false temples. The most savvy of these undead mages refuse to consolidate their power in a single location, often scattering lairs in a way that leads adventurers on chases across whole worlds.</p>
					<h>Merciless Schemers</h>
					<p>All liches understand the potential of do-gooder heroes to threaten their pursuits and destroy their soulstone, and they do everything in their power to stay on top of such threats. Adventurers with a trove of powerful supernatural treasures or the potential strength to resist a lich are hunted mercilessly. Liches know they have all the time in the world to plot against their foes, and have refined hatred into an art form.</p>
					<h>Lich Languages</h>
					<p>A lich speaks the languages they knew in life, and might also pick up Anjali, Proto-Ctholl, Variac, and Vastariax over their limitless lifetime.</p>
					<h>Lich Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of a lich&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>VALOK</h>
					<p>Abandoned autonomous machines made by the ancient steel dwarves, valok can still be found deep within the crumbling ruins and underground structures of long-dead civilizations. The steel dwarves made their instruments well, though, and valok can still be activated! However, doing so without the correct control phrases could unleash an unstoppable machine overloaded by the weight of time.</p>
					<h>Exotic Metal Body</h>
					<p>Steel dwarves unlocked the secrets of smithing valiar&#8212;the truemetal&#8212; prized not only for its strength and flexibility, but for its entrancing silvery white beauty. They could turn valiar into anything, from breathtaking weapons and exquisite buildings to hypnotic gossamer fabrics that are nearly transparent and virtually indestructible. The secrets of working with the truemetal disappeared with the steel dwarves, but not before they built the nigh-invulnerable bodies of the valok.</p>
					<h>Prismacore Power</h>
					<p>The steel dwarves also mined iridoss, commonly known as prismacore. This rare gemstone was infused with the power of other worlds. Unlike other constructs who are powered by spells or prayer, each valok&#8217;s prismacore heart allows them to operate without magic. Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.</p>
					<h>Mechanized Evolution</h>
					<p>The first valok were great machines made to dig, smelt, and build. Legends say these giant walkers could build entire cities in a matter of days, and could even construct other valok. As the steel dwarves learned the deep secrets of prismacore, they made machines who could speak and think more freely.</p>
					<p>While two classes of valok&#8212;servok and multivok&#8212;have been discovered, ancient steel dwarf carvings hint that a highly advanced third class was created just before their makers disappeared.</p>
					<h>Ancient and Deep</h>
					<p>Ruined valok litter the deepest ruins of the steel dwarves, and without the steel dwarves&#8217; secrets, their valiar and iridoss are useless to modern smiths. But some valok still labor in the depths, carrying out the orders given to them long ago and ready to end any who interfere.</p>
					<h>Servok</h>
					<p>Servoks, the labor and siege class of valok, are huge, slow, and built for a specific purpose&#8212;though all are designed to defend themselves when threatened. No humaniform servoks have yet been discovered. Their forms depend on their purpose, but they are never smaller than a wagon. Despite each servok&#8217;s utilitarian construction and the ages of grime accumulated atop their valiar, they are impressive to behold.</p>
					<p>Servok builders once constructed buildings, roads, and walls. Some active builders still work the caverns where they were left, clearing the ground in preparation for lost grand projects known only to their progenitors. Servok miners dug the legendary tunnels of the steel dwarves. A few miners still bore deep into the earth, searching for ore and ready to destroy anything that interferes with that function.</p>
					<p>The quaking of earth and the boom of an arcane cannon precedes the appearance of a servok war engine. Built to roll through enemy ranks with their bladed rake, the war engine can also eliminate targets from afar with a massive gun that shoots both magic blasts and burning oil. Many war engines went to battle and never returned, and where they wander now, they consider every creature they meet who isn&#8217;t a steel dwarf to be an enemy.</p>
					<h>Multivok</h>
					<p>Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks&#8212;tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.</p>
					<p>With arms ending in axe blades and repeating crossbows mounted on their shoulders, a multivok bodyguard cuts an impressive figure. Multivok bodyguards who are still active are often found watching over the bones or possessions of their long-dead charges with unfaltering loyalty.</p>
					<p>One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. Multivok chiefs were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, dig tunnels, and destroy invaders.</p>
					<h>Valok Languages</h>
					<p>Most valok communicate exclusively in Rallarian.</p>
					<h>Valok Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any valok&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Multivok</h>
					<p>Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids.

					<h>VALOK</h>
					<p>Abandoned autonomous machines made by the ancient steel dwarves, valok can still be found deep within the crumbling ruins and underground structures of long-dead civilizations. The steel dwarves made their instruments well, though, and valok can still be activated! However, doing so without the correct control phrases could unleash an unstoppable machine overloaded by the weight of time.</p>
					<h>Exotic Metal Body</h>
					<p>Steel dwarves unlocked the secrets of smithing valiar&#8212;the truemetal&#8212; prized not only for its strength and flexibility, but for its entrancing silvery white beauty. They could turn valiar into anything, from breathtaking weapons and exquisite buildings to hypnotic gossamer fabrics that are nearly transparent and virtually indestructible. The secrets of working with the truemetal disappeared with the steel dwarves, but not before they built the nigh-invulnerable bodies of the valok.</p>
					<h>Prismacore Power</h>
					<p>The steel dwarves also mined iridoss, commonly known as prismacore. This rare gemstone was infused with the power of other worlds. Unlike other constructs who are powered by spells or prayer, each valok&#8217;s prismacore heart allows them to operate without magic. Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.</p>

While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks&#8212;tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.</p>
					<p>With arms ending in axe blades and repeating crossbows mounted on their shoulders, a multivok bodyguard cuts an impressive figure. Multivok bodyguards who are still active are often found watching over the bones or possessions of their long-dead charges with unfaltering loyalty.</p>
					<p>One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. Multivok chiefs were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, dig tunnels, and destroy invaders.</p>
					<h>Valok Languages</h>
					<p>Most valok communicate exclusively in Rallarian.</p>
					<h>Valok Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any valok&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>VOICELESS TALKERS</h>
					<p>Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (sin-LEER-ee, singular: synliroi) are known as the &#8220;voiceless talkers&#8221; to the denizens of the World Below&#8212;and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the &#8220;barking ones&#8221; (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) an abomination that must be corrected.</p>
					<h>Uneasy Alliances</h>
					<p>Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.</p>
					<h>Olothec Hatred</h>
					<p>The synlirii&#8217;s visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say that the olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.</p>
					<h>Psionic Spies</h>
					<p>Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.</p>
					<h>Psi-Tech</h>
					<p>Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers&#8217; handheld psionic pistols and portable psionic rifles can be activated only by their alien minds.</p>
					<h>Creature Engineers</h>
					<p>Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don&#8217;t live long and aren&#8217;t intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers&#8217; Body Banks&#8212;most of them singular life forms who can&#8217;t reproduce and might never die.</p>
					<h>Graywarper</h>
					<p>Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities&#8212;and free will&#8212;as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.</p>
					<h>Hulking Brain</h>
					<p>The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid- shaped horrors with four massive arms and a large pulsing brain in place of a head. Called thylin&#231;a by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.</p>
					<h>Mindkiller</h>
					<p>Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers&#8217; pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid&#8217;s body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim&#8217;s central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim&#8217;s knowledge and memories and can puppet their body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller&#8217;s synlirii overlords.</p>
					<p>Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller who can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can&#8217;t inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes&#8217; mental defenses against psionics.</p>
					<h>Voiceless Talker Languages</h>
					<p>Most voiceless talkers communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Variac.</p>
					<h>Voiceless Talker Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any voiceless talker&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>VOICELESS TALKERS</h>
					<p>Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (sin-LEER-ee, singular: synliroi) are known as the &#8220;voiceless talkers&#8221; to the denizens of the World Below&#8212;and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the &#8220;barking ones&#8221; (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) an abomination that must be corrected.</p>
					<h>Uneasy Alliances</h>
					<p>Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.</p>
					<h>Olothec Hatred</h>
					<p>The synlirii&#8217;s visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say that the olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.</p>
					<h>Psionic Spies</h>
					<p>Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.</p>
					<h>Psi-Tech</h>
					<p>Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers&#8217; handheld psionic pistols and portable psionic rifles can be activated only by their alien minds.</p>
					<h>Creature Engineers</h>
					<p>Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don&#8217;t live long and aren&#8217;t intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers&#8217; Body Banks&#8212;most of them singular life forms who can&#8217;t reproduce and might never die.</p>
					<h>Graywarper</h>
					<p>Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities&#8212;and free will&#8212;as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.</p>
					<h>Hulking Brain</h>
					<p>The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid- shaped horrors with four massive arms and a large pulsing brain in place of a head. Called thylin&#231;a by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.</p>
					<h>Mindkiller</h>
					<p>Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers&#8217; pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid&#8217;s body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim&#8217;s central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim&#8217;s knowledge and memories and can puppet their body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller&#8217;s synlirii overlords.</p>
					<p>Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller who can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can&#8217;t inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes&#8217; mental defenses against psionics.</p>
					<h>Voiceless Talker Languages</h>
					<p>Most voiceless talkers communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Variac.</p>
					<h>Voiceless Talker Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any voiceless talker&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>VOICELESS TALKERS</h>
					<p>Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (sin-LEER-ee, singular: synliroi) are known as the &#8220;voiceless talkers&#8221; to the denizens of the World Below&#8212;and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the &#8220;barking ones&#8221; (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) an abomination that must be corrected.</p>
					<h>Uneasy Alliances</h>
					<p>Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.</p>
					<h>Olothec Hatred</h>
					<p>The synlirii&#8217;s visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say that the olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.</p>
					<h>Psionic Spies</h>
					<p>Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.</p>
					<h>Psi-Tech</h>
					<p>Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers&#8217; handheld psionic pistols and portable psionic rifles can be activated only by their alien minds.</p>
					<h>Creature Engineers</h>
					<p>Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don&#8217;t live long and aren&#8217;t intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers&#8217; Body Banks&#8212;most of them singular life forms who can&#8217;t reproduce and might never die.</p>
					<h>Graywarper</h>
					<p>Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities&#8212;and free will&#8212;as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.</p>
					<h>Hulking Brain</h>
					<p>The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid- shaped horrors with four massive arms and a large pulsing brain in place of a head. Called thylin&#231;a by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.</p>
					<h>Mindkiller</h>
					<p>Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers&#8217; pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid&#8217;s body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim&#8217;s central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim&#8217;s knowledge and memories and can puppet their body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller&#8217;s synlirii overlords.</p>
					<p>Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller who can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can&#8217;t inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes&#8217; mental defenses against psionics.</p>
					<h>Voiceless Talker Languages</h>
					<p>Most voiceless talkers communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Variac.</p>
					<h>Voiceless Talker Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of any voiceless talker&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Lord Syuul</h>
					<p>&#8220;Yours is an interesting mind, Tyract. I wonder what it tastes like?&#8221;</p>
					<p>Chief Design Architect of the living synlirii high science vessel Waking Nightmare, Lord Syuul (see-YOU-ull) scours the timescape looking for novel genetic specimens he can torture into new species. His spies, informants, and allies are always on the lookout for subjects with unique hereditary traits the Interlace might extract.</p>
					<h>The Extractors</h>
					<p>Syuul&#8217;s most trusted servants form his elite surgical commandos, the Extractors. Whenever his ship detects the presence of some novel or unique genetic ability, they dispatch a small team of synlirii genetic surgeons and a single scanner.</p>
					<p>Scanners are 4-foot-tall floating glass cylinders filled with solid brain material and cerebrospinal fluid. They hover in place, scanning and cataloging every living being in the area in an instant.</p>
					<p>The scanner identifies any creatures with valuable hereditary abilities so the Extractors can apply the Interlace, siphoning off the victim&#8217;s unique abilities.</p>
					<p>Miraculously, some subjects survive this process. Those who do find they no longer have access to whatever hereditary traits the Extractors stole.</p>
					<h>Mind Masters of the Timescape</h>
					<p>Known to his servants and thralls as the Architect of Change, Syuul&#8217;s research is no mere academic pursuit. He works tirelessly to build a catalog of mutations and hereditary traits. Talents, with their innate ability to turn thoughts into raw power, are his current obsession.</p>
					<p>Lord Syuul remembers a time when his people ruled the world of Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, as gods. Before the time raiders rebelled, before the synlirii retreated to the World Below. While his fellow genetic architects are content to rule the Dark Under All, Syuul burns with hatred.</p>
					<p>Hatred not just of the time raiders and the ungrateful proteans, but of every living being not under his direct control.</p>
					<p>He no longer values his original technological marvel, the Body Banks, and so was happy to trade that obsolete invention to Ajax&#8217;s wizard Mortum in exchange for more genetic material.</p>
					<p>The Body Banks were limited. They required manually feeding specimens into the tanks. His new device allows Lord Syuul to dynamically rewrite a living being&#8217;s genetic material from a distance. From any distance.</p>
					<p>In his mind, everything that is not Lord Syuul is flawed. When his new device is complete, he will remake the timescape in his own image. Every living being, a formless mass of mind and flesh thinking only Syuul&#8217;s thoughts.</p>
					<h>Lord Syuul&#8217;s Languages</h>
					<p>Lord Syuul communicates telepathically using Mindspeech and speaks Variac.</p>
					<h>Lord Syuul&#8217;s Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of Lord Syuul&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;1st Echelon</h>
					<p>The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 1+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;1st Echelon</h>
					<p>The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.</p>

					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;1st Echelon</h>
					<p>The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 1+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;1st Echelon</h>
					<p>The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 1+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;1st Echelon</h>
					<p>The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 1+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>War Dogs&#8212;1st Echelon</h>
					<p>The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax&#8217;s war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.</p>
					<h>Shrikeguns</h>
					<p>The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs. When loosed, a standard shrikegun throws a five-inch, iron-tipped wooden stake hard enough to reliably pierce steel plate at 50 yards. The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the &#8220;shrike scream&#8221; of a loosed volley.</p>
					<h>Fuse-Iron</h>
					<p>Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light. Special arrangements of fuse-iron utilize crush cavities to create concussive detonations that are incredibly powerful, if not particularly reliable. Fuse-iron is expensive, accident-prone, and almost impossible to work with in large quantities, so that fuse-iron equipment is granted only to war dog specialists.</p>
					<h>Houndweapons</h>
					<p>Insubordinate war dogs are usually punished with a trip back to the Body Banks, but individuals who need to be made an example of are condemned to an even harsher fate: becoming a houndweapon. These living weapons are horrific blends of flesh, machine, and spirit created as powerful and terribly cruel tools of war. Only the highest-ranking and most capable war dogs can requisition houndweapons, given those living armaments&#8217; power and the time and difficulty involved in making them.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 4+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax&#8217;s war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.</p>
					<h>Shrikeguns</h>
					<p>The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs.

The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the &#8220;shrike scream&#8221; of a loosed volley.</p>
					<h>Fuse-Iron</h>
					<p>Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light.

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax&#8217;s war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.</p>
					<h>Shrikeguns</h>
					<p>The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs. When loosed, a standard shrikegun throws a five-inch, iron-tipped wooden stake hard enough to reliably pierce steel plate at 50 yards. The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the &#8220;shrike scream&#8221; of a loosed volley.</p>
					<h>Fuse-Iron</h>
					<p>Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light. Special arrangements of fuse-iron utilize crush cavities to create concussive detonations that are incredibly powerful, if not particularly reliable. Fuse-iron is expensive, accident-prone, and almost impossible to work with in large quantities, so that fuse-iron equipment is granted only to war dog specialists.</p>
					<h>Houndweapons</h>
					<p>Insubordinate war dogs are usually punished with a trip back to the Body Banks, but individuals who need to be made an example of are condemned to an even harsher fate: becoming a houndweapon. These living weapons are horrific blends of flesh, machine, and spirit created as powerful and terribly cruel tools of war. Only the highest-ranking and most capable war dogs can requisition houndweapons, given those living armaments&#8217; power and the time and difficulty involved in making them.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 4+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax&#8217;s war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.</p>
					<h>Shrikeguns</h>
					<p>The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs. When loosed, a standard shrikegun throws a five-inch, iron-tipped wooden stake hard enough to reliably pierce steel plate at 50 yards. The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the &#8220;shrike scream&#8221; of a loosed volley.</p>
					<h>Fuse-Iron</h>
					<p>Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light. Special arrangements of fuse-iron utilize crush cavities to create concussive detonations that are incredibly powerful, if not particularly reliable. Fuse-iron is expensive, accident-prone, and almost impossible to work with in large quantities, so that fuse-iron equipment is granted only to war dog specialists.</p>
					<h>Houndweapons</h>
					<p>Insubordinate war dogs are usually punished with a trip back to the Body Banks, but individuals who need to be made an example of are condemned to an even harsher fate: becoming a houndweapon. These living weapons are horrific blends of flesh, machine, and spirit created as powerful and terribly cruel tools of war. Only the highest-ranking and most capable war dogs can requisition houndweapons, given those living armaments&#8217; power and the time and difficulty involved in making them.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 4+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings.

					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>

					<h>War Dogs&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax&#8217;s war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;2nd Echelon</h>
					<p>War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax&#8217;s war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.</p>
					<h>Shrikeguns</h>
					<p>The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs. When loosed, a standard shrikegun throws a five-inch, iron-tipped wooden stake hard enough to reliably pierce steel plate at 50 yards. The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the &#8220;shrike scream&#8221; of a loosed volley.</p>
					<h>Fuse-Iron</h>
					<p>Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light. Special arrangements of fuse-iron utilize crush cavities to create concussive detonations that are incredibly powerful, if not particularly reliable. Fuse-iron is expensive, accident-prone, and almost impossible to work with in large quantities, so that fuse-iron equipment is granted only to war dog specialists.</p>
					<h>Houndweapons</h>
					<p>Insubordinate war dogs are usually punished with a trip back to the Body Banks, but individuals who need to be made an example of are condemned to an even harsher fate: becoming a houndweapon. These living weapons are horrific blends of flesh, machine, and spirit created as powerful and terribly cruel tools of war. Only the highest-ranking and most capable war dogs can requisition houndweapons, given those living armaments&#8217; power and the time and difficulty involved in making them.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 4+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.</p>
					<h>Happy Accidents</h>
					<p>Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.</p>
					<h>Made to Order</h>
					<p>War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new resurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.</p>
					<p>These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.</p>
					<h>Happy Accidents</h>
					<p>Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.</p>
					<h>Made to Order</h>
					<p>War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new resurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.</p>
					<p>These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 7+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.</p>
					<h>Happy Accidents</h>
					<p>Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.</p>
					<h>Made to Order</h>
					<p>War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new resurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.</p>
					<p>These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;3rd Echelon</h>
					<p>As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.</p>
					<h>Happy Accidents</h>
					<p>Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.</p>
					<h>Made to Order</h>
					<p>War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new resurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.</p>
					<p>These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.</p>

					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>

					<p>As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.</p>
					<h>Happy Accidents</h>
					<p>Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.</p>
					<h>Made to Order</h>
					<p>War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new resurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.</p>
					<p>These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>At the apex of the war dog command structure, a number of infamous figures are known for their brutal tactics, legendary battle prowess, and unbreakable loyalty to Ajax.</p>
					<h>Castellan Hoplon</h>
					<p>Hoplon&#8217;s scars are not from the Body Banks, but from years of combat and hard-fought sieges. A master of the harrying retreat, the holdfast, and the last stand, Hoplon is there to lead the defense wherever the fighting is most intense and the lines threaten to buckle.</p>
					<h>Iron Champion Doru</h>
					<p>Upon the accidental creation of the Iron Champion, only the intervention of Ajax was able to stop Doru&#8217;s rampage. His raw strength and untempered aggression make him a valuable combatant, but it is his mysterious regeneration that makes him a true monster on the battlefield.</p>
					<h>Logostician Vesper</h>
					<p>A master of logistical support and a living portal network, Vesper is the emergent personality of several dozen potent psychic minds working in concert. From their position within an armored and highly mobile flesh chassis, Vesper manages supply lines and transport for the forces of the Iron Saint.</p>
					<h>Soulbinder Psyche</h>
					<p>Viewed by other war dogs as &#8220;The Goddess of the Banks,&#8221; Psyche possesses a spirit that can return from the Body Banks again and again without ever losing her core self. She is a master of the connection between soul and flesh, and a talented mage besides.</p>
					<h>Strategos Alkestis</h>
					<p>Leader of the Legion Alkestis and one of the most brilliant commanders ever to be born a war dog, Alkestis has made her legion one of the most feared of Ajax&#8217;s armies. The Silver Wolf is known for her battlefield tactics and a willingness to stoop to any depths to gain an edge on her enemies.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 10+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>At the apex of the war dog command structure, a number of infamous figures are known for their brutal tactics, legendary battle prowess, and unbreakable loyalty to Ajax.</p>
					<h>Castellan Hoplon</h>
					<p>Hoplon&#8217;s scars are not from the Body Banks, but from years of combat and hard-fought sieges. A master of the harrying retreat, the holdfast, and the last stand, Hoplon is there to lead the defense wherever the fighting is most intense and the lines threaten to buckle.</p>
					<h>Iron Champion Doru</h>
					<p>Upon the accidental creation of the Iron Champion, only the intervention of Ajax was able to stop Doru&#8217;s rampage. His raw strength and untempered aggression make him a valuable combatant, but it is his mysterious regeneration that makes him a true monster on the battlefield.</p>
					<h>Logostician Vesper</h>
					<p>A master of logistical support and a living portal network, Vesper is the emergent personality of several dozen potent psychic minds working in concert. From their position within an armored and highly mobile flesh chassis, Vesper manages supply lines and transport for the forces of the Iron Saint.</p>
					<h>Soulbinder Psyche</h>
					<p>Viewed by other war dogs as &#8220;The Goddess of the Banks,&#8221; Psyche possesses a spirit that can return from the Body Banks again and again without ever losing her core self. She is a master of the connection between soul and flesh, and a talented mage besides.</p>
					<h>Strategos Alkestis</h>
					<p>Leader of the Legion Alkestis and one of the most brilliant commanders ever to be born a war dog, Alkestis has made her legion one of the most feared of Ajax&#8217;s armies. The Silver Wolf is known for her battlefield tactics and a willingness to stoop to any depths to gain an edge on her enemies.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 10+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>At the apex of the war dog command structure, a number of infamous figures are known for their brutal tactics, legendary battle prowess, and unbreakable loyalty to Ajax.</p>
					<h>Castellan Hoplon</h>
					<p>Hoplon&#8217;s scars are not from the Body Banks, but from years of combat and hard-fought sieges. A master of the harrying retreat, the holdfast, and the last stand, Hoplon is there to lead the defense wherever the fighting is most intense and the lines threaten to buckle.</p>
					<h>Iron Champion Doru</h>
					<p>Upon the accidental creation of the Iron Champion, only the intervention of Ajax was able to stop Doru&#8217;s rampage. His raw strength and untempered aggression make him a valuable combatant, but it is his mysterious regeneration that makes him a true monster on the battlefield.</p>
					<h>Logostician Vesper</h>
					<p>A master of logistical support and a living portal network, Vesper is the emergent personality of several dozen potent psychic minds working in concert. From their position within an armored and highly mobile flesh chassis, Vesper manages supply lines and transport for the forces of the Iron Saint.</p>
					<h>Soulbinder Psyche</h>
					<p>Viewed by other war dogs as &#8220;The Goddess of the Banks,&#8221; Psyche possesses a spirit that can return from the Body Banks again and again without ever losing her core self. She is a master of the connection between soul and flesh, and a talented mage besides.</p>
					<h>Strategos Alkestis</h>
					<p>Leader of the Legion Alkestis and one of the most brilliant commanders ever to be born a war dog, Alkestis has made her legion one of the most feared of Ajax&#8217;s armies. The Silver Wolf is known for her battlefield tactics and a willingness to stoop to any depths to gain an edge on her enemies.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 10+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>At the apex of the war dog command structure, a number of infamous figures are known for their brutal tactics, legendary battle prowess, and unbreakable loyalty to Ajax.</p>
					<h>Castellan Hoplon</h>
					<p>Hoplon&#8217;s scars are not from the Body Banks, but from years of combat and hard-fought sieges. A master of the harrying retreat, the holdfast, and the last stand, Hoplon is there to lead the defense wherever the fighting is most intense and the lines threaten to buckle.</p>
					<h>Iron Champion Doru</h>
					<p>Upon the accidental creation of the Iron Champion, only the intervention of Ajax was able to stop Doru&#8217;s rampage. His raw strength and untempered aggression make him a valuable combatant, but it is his mysterious regeneration that makes him a true monster on the battlefield.</p>
					<h>Logostician Vesper</h>
					<p>A master of logistical support and a living portal network, Vesper is the emergent personality of several dozen potent psychic minds working in concert. From their position within an armored and highly mobile flesh chassis, Vesper manages supply lines and transport for the forces of the Iron Saint.</p>
					<h>Soulbinder Psyche</h>
					<p>Viewed by other war dogs as &#8220;The Goddess of the Banks,&#8221; Psyche possesses a spirit that can return from the Body Banks again and again without ever losing her core self. She is a master of the connection between soul and flesh, and a talented mage besides.</p>
					<h>Strategos Alkestis</h>
					<p>Leader of the Legion Alkestis and one of the most brilliant commanders ever to be born a war dog, Alkestis has made her legion one of the most feared of Ajax&#8217;s armies. The Silver Wolf is known for her battlefield tactics and a willingness to stoop to any depths to gain an edge on her enemies.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 10+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WAR DOGS</h>
					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>

					<p>Ajax&#8217;s war dogs&#8212;brutal patchwork soldiers&#8212;owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don&#8217;t survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.</p>
					<h>Withdrawn From the Body Banks</h>
					<p>Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.</p>
					<h>Soulless Soldiers</h>
					<p>War dogs aren&#8217;t undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn&#8217;t escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.</p>
					<h>Enlisted at Rebirth</h>
					<p>From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax&#8217;s war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.</p>
					<p>Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax&#8217;s ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars&#8212;unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges&#8212;and sent on to join a legion.</p>
					<h>Chain of Command</h>
					<p>Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.</p>
					<p>Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.</p>
					<h>War Dog Languages</h>
					<p>Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
					<h>War Dogs&#8212;4th Echelon</h>
					<p>At the apex of the war dog command structure, a number of infamous figures are known for their brutal tactics, legendary battle prowess, and unbreakable loyalty to Ajax.</p>
					<h>Castellan Hoplon</h>
					<p>Hoplon&#8217;s scars are not from the Body Banks, but from years of combat and hard-fought sieges. A master of the harrying retreat, the holdfast, and the last stand, Hoplon is there to lead the defense wherever the fighting is most intense and the lines threaten to buckle.</p>
					<h>Iron Champion Doru</h>
					<p>Upon the accidental creation of the Iron Champion, only the intervention of Ajax was able to stop Doru&#8217;s rampage. His raw strength and untempered aggression make him a valuable combatant, but it is his mysterious regeneration that makes him a true monster on the battlefield.</p>
					<h>Logostician Vesper</h>
					<p>A master of logistical support and a living portal network, Vesper is the emergent personality of several dozen potent psychic minds working in concert. From their position within an armored and highly mobile flesh chassis, Vesper manages supply lines and transport for the forces of the Iron Saint.</p>
					<h>Soulbinder Psyche</h>
					<p>Viewed by other war dogs as &#8220;The Goddess of the Banks,&#8221; Psyche possesses a spirit that can return from the Body Banks again and again without ever losing her core self. She is a master of the connection between soul and flesh, and a talented mage besides.</p>
					<h>Strategos Alkestis</h>
					<p>Leader of the Legion Alkestis and one of the most brilliant commanders ever to be born a war dog, Alkestis has made her legion one of the most feared of Ajax&#8217;s armies. The Silver Wolf is known for her battlefield tactics and a willingness to stoop to any depths to gain an edge on her enemies.</p>
					<h>War Dog Malice Level 10+</h>
					<p>At the start of any war dog&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WEREWOLF</h>
					<p>A wolf howls and your bowels freeze. Terror overcomes you. Sweat makes your skin slick, your senses sharpened. The moon is high but you feel hot. You&#8217;re burning up. There&#8217;s blood in your mouth and a corpse at your feet. Where did that come from?! That animal &#8230; that thing that almost clawed you to death last week &#8230; was it a wolf? Was it just a wolf?</p>
					<p>Werewolves are shapeshifters filled with a need to rend and tear. They used to be ordinary humans, elves, polders, and the like. But when their feral compulsion takes control, their eyes turn blood red and they change into massive wolves or abominable hybrid beasts.</p>
					<h>Howling Primordial Chaos</h>
					<p>Werewolves are swirling conductors of the Primordial Chaos. Their bodies overflow with energy, almost painfully so. They shift and expand their forms into more beastlike shapes to best contain their power. And one bite is all it takes for those ferocious forces to flow into their next host.</p>
					<h>Brokered or Cursed</h>
					<p>The curse of the werewolf is actively sought out by terrible nobles and rulers looking to extend their power and instill fear into their people. They secure deals with devils who can tap into the Primordial Chaos and unleash their beast, usually in exchange for relinquishing their legacy after they pass.</p>
					<p>Laypeople don&#8217;t have the luxury of a legacy, nor do they have councils that can help temper a werewolf. They know full well the horror of losing oneself to the beast, and take action to rout out the threat of a werewolf among them. Fear leaves people submissive to the demands of cursed kings, yet oppressive to their own accursed kin.</p>
					<h>On Wights and Weres</h>
					<p>The powers that created the werewolves were also harnessed and cultivated under the traditions of the stormwight fury. A werewolf&#8217;s accursed rage can&#8217;t overcome the stormwight&#8217;s ferocity, nor can ferocity overpower rage. It&#8217;s not uncommon for werewolves to subconsciously treat encounters with stormwight furies as if they were sport.</p>
					<h>Werewolf Languages</h>
					<p>Werewolves can speak any language they knew before they were cursed. A werewolf who has spent time researching their curse might also know Khamish, Anjali, or Khelt, depending on the circumstances underlying their transformation.</p>
					<h>Werewolf Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of a werewolf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>WYVERNS</h>

				<nonid_name type="string">Horror, Overmind</nonid_name>
				<notes type="formattedtext">
					<h>Xorannox the Tyract</h>
					<p>Xorannox the Tyract is an overmind. Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural: vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.</p>
					<h>Psionic Eyes</h>
					<p>An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.</p>
					<h>Intelligent Loremasters</h>
					<p>Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren&#8217;t usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.</p>
					<h>Overmind Lairs</h>
					<p>Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.</p>
					<h>Rivalries and Negotiations</h>
					<p>Unlike the synlirii and the olothec, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.</p>
					<h>Smelly Eggs</h>
					<p>Overmind procreation involves one horror laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can&#8217;t ignore.</p>
					<p>Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If the egg is fertilized, the explorer could find themselves becoming a newly hatched overmind&#8217;s first victim.</p>
					<h>Xorannox the Tyract</h>
					<p>Xorannox (ZOR-ah-nocks) rules as Lord of the White Tower, an isolated, multilevel finger of alabaster stone connecting to the World Below. He is commonly known as the Tyract, an ancient Za&#8217;hariax word that literally translates as &#8220;a king who rules with his teeth&#8221;&#8212;and the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.</p>
					<p>Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the voiceless talkers&#8217; great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god. The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he&#8217;s delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. Thus when the gauntlet is thrown and his life is in danger, the only minions he can truly trust are his own six eyes.</p>
					<h>Xorannox&#8217;s Languages</h>
					<p>Overminds typically speak Za&#8217;hariax. Xorannox also speaks Caelian, Hyrallic, and Voll.</p>
					<h>Xorannox&#8217;s Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of Xorannox&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Xorannox the Tyract</h>
					<p>Xorannox the Tyract is an overmind. Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural: vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.</p>
					<h>Psionic Eyes</h>
					<p>An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.</p>
					<h>Intelligent Loremasters</h>
					<p>Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren&#8217;t usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.</p>
					<h>Overmind Lairs</h>
					<p>Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.</p>
					<h>Rivalries and Negotiations</h>
					<p>Unlike the synlirii and the olothec, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.</p>
					<h>Smelly Eggs</h>
					<p>Overmind procreation involves one horror laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can&#8217;t ignore.</p>
					<p>Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If the egg is fertilized, the explorer could find themselves becoming a newly hatched overmind&#8217;s first victim.</p>
					<h>Xorannox the Tyract</h>
					<p>Xorannox (ZOR-ah-nocks) rules as Lord of the White Tower, an isolated, multilevel finger of alabaster stone connecting to the World Below. He is commonly known as the Tyract, an ancient Za&#8217;hariax word that literally translates as &#8220;a king who rules with his teeth&#8221;&#8212;and the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.</p>
					<p>Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the voiceless talkers&#8217; great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god. The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he&#8217;s delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. Thus when the gauntlet is thrown and his life is in danger, the only minions he can truly trust are his own six eyes.</p>
					<h>Xorannox&#8217;s Languages</h>
					<p>Overminds typically speak Za&#8217;hariax. Xorannox also speaks Caelian, Hyrallic, and Voll.</p>
					<h>Xorannox&#8217;s Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of Xorannox&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

					<h>Xorannox the Tyract</h>
					<p>Xorannox the Tyract is an overmind. Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural: vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.</p>
					<h>Psionic Eyes</h>
					<p>An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.</p>
					<h>Intelligent Loremasters</h>
					<p>Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren&#8217;t usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.</p>
					<h>Overmind Lairs</h>
					<p>Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.</p>
					<h>Rivalries and Negotiations</h>
					<p>Unlike the synlirii and the olothec, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.</p>
					<h>Smelly Eggs</h>
					<p>Overmind procreation involves one horror laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can&#8217;t ignore.</p>
					<p>Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If the egg is fertilized, the explorer could find themselves becoming a newly hatched overmind&#8217;s first victim.</p>
					<h>Xorannox the Tyract</h>
					<p>Xorannox (ZOR-ah-nocks) rules as Lord of the White Tower, an isolated, multilevel finger of alabaster stone connecting to the World Below. He is commonly known as the Tyract, an ancient Za&#8217;hariax word that literally translates as &#8220;a king who rules with his teeth&#8221;&#8212;and the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.</p>
					<p>Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the voiceless talkers&#8217; great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god. The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he&#8217;s delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. Thus when the gauntlet is thrown and his life is in danger, the only minions he can truly trust are his own six eyes.</p>
					<h>Xorannox&#8217;s Languages</h>
					<p>Overminds typically speak Za&#8217;hariax. Xorannox also speaks Caelian, Hyrallic, and Voll.</p>
					<h>Xorannox&#8217;s Malice</h>
					<p>At the start of Xorannox&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>
