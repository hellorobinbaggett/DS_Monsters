				<effect type="string">The shadow elves synthesize a concentrated pocket manifold reminiscent of Equinox and graft it onto the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, all creatures can see shadow elves in full color, and shadow elves no longer benefit from their Of the Umbra trait. Additionally, the potency of all shadow elf abilities increases by 2, and any enemy making a saving throw against an effect imposed by a shadow elf ability must roll an 8 or higher as they feel the effect across two worlds.</effect>

						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Lydixavus the Deadeye</h>
						<p>Nothing escapes Lydixavus (lee-DIX-uh-vas) or their unrivaled precision. After decades of careful training, they have honed their breath weapon into a swift and far-traveling bullet of ice. Lydixavus is motivated by revenge. Each scar, each dent in their scales tells a story, and Lydixavus aims to return those gifts tenfold to those who bestowed them.</p>
						<h>Draconian Languages</h>
						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.</p>
						<h>Draconian Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any draconian's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

						<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
						<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
						<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
						<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>
						<h>Indicator Species</h>
						<p>Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn&#8217;t take much to upset that balance. While toxins don&#8217;t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
						<h>Moisture Dependent</h>
						<p>Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>
						<h>Clawfish</h>
						<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.</p>
						<h>Angulotl Languages</h>
						<p>Most angulotls speak Filliaric.</p>
						<h>Wet</h>
						<p>Angulotls make use of a unique effect called &#8220;wet.&#8221; While wet, an angulotl doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.</p>

						<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
						<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
						<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
						<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>

Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
						<h>Moisture Dependent</h>

						<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs.

						<h>ANGULOTLS</h>
						<p>Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa- LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they&#8217;re threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.</p>
						<h>Deadly Toxins</h>
						<p>Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression&#8212;because they don&#8217;t need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.</p>
						<h>Indicator Species</h>
						<p>Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn&#8217;t take much to upset that balance. While toxins don&#8217;t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path&#8212;even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most&#8212;and sometimes grants them strange abilities.</p>
						<h>Moisture Dependent</h>
						<p>Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>
						<h>Clawfish</h>
						<p>Known as q&#8217;ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.</p>
						<h>Angulotl Languages</h>
						<p>Most angulotls speak Filliaric.</p>
						<h>Wet</h>
						<p>Angulotls make use of a unique effect called &#8220;wet.&#8221; While wet, an angulotl doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.</p>
						<h>Angulotl Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any angulotl&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

						<h>ARIXX</h>
						<p>Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon&#8217;s peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal&#8212; sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.</p>
						<p>An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.</p>
						<h>Pastoral Pest</h>
						<p>Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate&#8212;unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.</p>
						<h>Terror of the Thaw</h>
						<p>Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.</p>
						<h>Arixx Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an arixx&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ANIMALS</h>
						<p>The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal&#8212;to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn&#8217;t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves&#8212;but they&#8217;ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.</p>
						<h>Animal Traits</h>
						<p>This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal&#8217;s most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block&#8217;s EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.</p>

					<notes type="formattedtext">
						<h>On Ajax</h>
						<p>He bestrides the land like one of history&#8217;s great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures&#8212;and no one to stand in his way.</p>
						<h>By Might and Merit</h>
						<p>Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital&#8217;s military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire&#8217;s conquests before them. Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis&#8212;an ancient flying sky-elf city&#8212;to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country&#8212;no one could ignore their might any longer.</p>
						<h>Treasures Abound</h>
						<p>Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person&#8217;s willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic. His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn&#8217;t prepared to handle.</p>
						<h>The Iron Saint</h>
						<p>While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn&#8217;t taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It&#8217;s up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.</p>
						<h>Ajax&#8217;s Languages</h>
						<p>Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.</p>
						<h>Tactical Stance</h>
						<p>At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:</p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00009">Ability: Insurgent</link>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00010">Ability: Mastermind</link>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00011">Ability: Vanguard</link>
						</linklist>
						<h>Ajax's Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of Ajax&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>
						<linklist>
							<link class="ability" recordname="ability.id-00012">Ability: Reason</link>

						<h>ASHEN HOARDER</h>
						<p>Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders&#8212;hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.</p>
						<h>Appendages and Spikes</h>
						<p>Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct&#8217;s grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies. When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer&#8217;s door.</p>
						<h>Weaponized Bodies</h>
						<p>These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies&#8217; remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.</p>
						<h>Soul Shackle</h>
						<p>Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle&#8212; usually a ring or an amulet&#8212;that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder&#8217;s remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.</p>
						<h>Ashen Hoarder Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an ashen hoarder&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BASILISKS</h>
						<p>With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat&#8212;even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into an immobilized stone statue who remains thankfully unaware when the basilisk later consumes their petrified form at their leisure.</p>
						<h>Raising Young</h>
						<p>Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. By contrast, basilisk younglings can eat only petrified victims, and basilisks have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.</p>
						<h>Dangerous Servitors</h>
						<p>Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to hatch, raising and training basilisks as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone when a basilisk escapes and runs amok. Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas commonly keep basilisks as pets, owing to their own limited options for companionship. Both parties benefit from this relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.</p>
						<h>Alchemical Properties</h>
						<p>Alchemists have discovered a gland in the basilisk&#8217;s mouth that excretes an oil that reverts stone to flesh, making it easier to digest prey. If enough of the oil is collected, a salve can be created to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.</p>
						<h>Basilisk Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any basilisk&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BREDBEDDLE</h>
						<p>In their true forms, bredbeddles are ogre-sized headless giants. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passers-by and magically adopt their victims&#8217; forms. Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facade only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.</p>
						<h>Immortal Wanderers</h>
						<p>Bredbeddles don&#8217;t age, and if they are slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giant kind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giant kind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Tales tell of how their heads are kept for safekeeping in a fire giant&#8217;s cellar to be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior, which no bredbeddle has exhibited thus far.</p>
						<h>Green with Frenzy</h>
						<p>The longer a bredbeddle goes without a head, the more twisted and desperate their power grows. Their desire to be whole stretches out of their body in the form of shadowy dark-green ribbons, wrapping around and clinging to every surface they spill onto. Travelers warn one another of roads rumored to be haunted by &#8220;wild green knights,&#8221; often avoiding these routes for months. No journey is worth losing your head over.</p>
						<h>Bredbeddle Languages</h>
						<p>When a bredbeddle communicates, they typically use High Kuric or the languages that their head&#8217;s previous owner knew. A bredbeddle who has taken multiple heads over their lifetime most likely knows Caelian as well.</p>
						<h>Bredbeddle Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a bredbeddle&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BUGBEARS</h>
						<p>Bugbears are the bu&#8217;gath in the Khelt language, or &#8220;the bearers of the great fear.&#8221; Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps. Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.</p>
						<h>Thrown Into the Fray</h>
						<p>Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors&#8217; homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude. When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.</p>
						<h>Goblin Bond</h>
						<p>Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.</p>
						<h>Bu&#8217;gathic Magic</h>
						<p>Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu&#8217;gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands. Bugbear Languages Most bugbears speak Caelian, Khelt, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Bugbear Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any bugbear&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>BUGBEARS</h>
						<p>Bugbears are the bu&#8217;gath in the Khelt language, or &#8220;the bearers of the great fear.&#8221; Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps. Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.</p>
						<h>Thrown Into the Fray</h>
						<p>Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors&#8217; homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude. When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.</p>
						<h>Goblin Bond</h>
						<p>Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.</p>
						<h>Bu&#8217;gathic Magic</h>
						<p>Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu&#8217;gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands.

						<h>CHIMERA</h>
						<p>Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in their throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor&#8212;but few know this creature&#8217;s origins as a divine guardian.</p>
						<h>The First Chimera</h>
						<p>The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian&#8212;one with a dragon&#8217;s cunning, a lion&#8217;s bravery, and a ram&#8217;s tenacity. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector not just for herself but also her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the beast. As a conquering force swept into the land, slaughtering the chimera was their fell goal. The queen&#8217;s resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras destroyed the opposing army, then dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.</p>
						<h>Tactical Warriors</h>
						<p>Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The three heads crying out together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.</p>
						<h>One Being, Three Heads</h>
						<p>Unlike some other multiheaded creatures, a chimera possesses a single unified mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera&#8217;s emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.</p>
						<h>Chimera Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a chimera&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 1+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>

						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 4+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>

The handmaiden always moves with and occupies the same space as the host and can’t be separated from them. While totally within the creature, the handmaiden doesn’t have line of effect to the host or targets outside the host and vice versa. \n\nAs a maneuver, the handmaiden can emerge from the host as a horrifying tower of flesh and bone that remains attached to the host’s insides. While emerged, the handmaiden can use a move action to make the host move up to their speed and has access to the host’s signature abilities, using the host’s modifiers for any power rolls. The handmaiden has the same Stability as the host. If the handmaiden or host is force moved, the other moves with them. While emerged, the handmaiden can be targeted independently of the host. The handmaiden can retreat totally within the host’s body as a maneuver. If the handmaiden dies, their remains separate from the host. \n\nThe Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes can be used to find a cure that removes a handmaiden from a host.

						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think.

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 10+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEMONS</h>
						<p>Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun. The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.</p>
						<h>Mortal Alliances</h>
						<p>Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.</p>
						<h>Soul Reavers</h>
						<p>Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.</p>
						<h>Lethe</h>
						<p>When a demon&#8217;s soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe&#8212;a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.</p>
						<h>Demonic Hierarchy</h>
						<p>Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don&#8217;t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. Each time a demon consumes a soul, there&#8217;s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt&#8212;or heroic.</p>
						<h>Demon Languages</h>
						<p>Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.</p>
						<h>Demon Malice Level 10+</h>
						<p>At the start of any demon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DEVILS</h>
						<p>In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control&#8212;a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.</p>
						<h>Precarious Pyramids</h>
						<p>The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they&#8217;re always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.</p>
						<h>Silver Tongues</h>
						<p>Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil&#8217;s supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
						<h>True Names</h>
						<p>All devils have two names: one by which they&#8217;re commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them&#8212;or in stripping them of their power.</p>
						<h>Hell&#8217;s Defectors</h>
						<p>Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell&#8217;s bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.</p>
						<h>Devil Languages</h>
						<p>Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.</p>

						<h>DEVILS</h>
						<p>In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control&#8212;a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.</p>
						<h>Precarious Pyramids</h>
						<p>The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they&#8217;re always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.</p>
						<h>Silver Tongues</h>
						<p>Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil&#8217;s supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
						<h>True Names</h>
						<p>All devils have two names: one by which they&#8217;re commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them&#8212;or in stripping them of their power.</p>
						<h>Hell&#8217;s Defectors</h>
						<p>Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell&#8217;s bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.</p>
						<h>Devil Languages</h>
						<p>Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.</p>
						<h>Devil Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any devil&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DRACONIANS</h>
						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Aeolyxria the Uncanny</h>
						<p>From the moment she hatched, Aeolyxria (ay-oh-LIX-ree-ah) has enjoyed a fascination with the occult. She wanders the land, gathering strange tomes and artifacts to study. When she takes a job, it&#8217;s because she has a new doohickey she wants to test out. Aeolyxria possesses a sharp, tactical mind that lets her treat any battlefield as if it offered homefield advantage. If she could just get a handle on all her equipment, she&#8217;d be unstoppable!</p>

						<h>DRACONIANS</h>
						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Locratix the Morningstar</h>
						<p>A traveler from a faraway land and the sole progeny of her Dracogenesis clutch, Locratix (low-CRA-tics) focuses on survival over all other things. The very concept of the dragon knights is anathema to her, as there is no reason a wyrmwight should hand over the power that keeps them alive. Locratix travels widely while taking on mercenary jobs, but she is always just one better deal away from skewering her present employer on the end of her lance.</p>
						<h>Draconian Languages</h>
						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.</p>

						<h>Myxovidan the Sintaker</h>
						<p>Myxovidan (mix-OH-vih-din) was raised by a secluded order of monks who claimed his obsidian-black scales and nausea-inducing breath were an evil that must be purged. They subjected him to an austere lifestyle, full of intense training, meditation, and denial of worldly pleasures. But Myxovidan&#8217;s hunger would be satisfied, one way or another. When Myxovidan departed the order, he left behind a collection of emaciated monk corpses who looked as though they&#8217;d had the life sucked out of them.</p>

						<h>Phrrygalax the Subduer</h>
						<p>Phrrygalax (fuh-RIJ-ih-lax) was once a dragon knight in the service of Good King Omund. Though he took the oath to defend others against tyranny, he was always keenly aware he was created for violence. When the betrayal of the dragon knight Mandrake fractured the Dragon Phalanx that was the order of the dragon knights, Phrrygalax gleefully renounced his oath to follow what he believes to be his true, brutal purpose. Many who served with him believed he was merely waiting for a convenient excuse to do so.</p>

						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax.

						<h>DRACONIANS</h>
						<p>Draconians&#8212;wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden&#8212;are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training. Six individual draconians are presented in this section&#8212;not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.</p>
						<h>Dorzinuuth the Base</h>
						<p>To those who know the Dragon Phalanx of old, no name inspires more awe and fear than that of Dorzinuuth (dor-ZIN-yew-uth). A mastermind on the battlefield and the foundation of the dragon knights&#8217; fraternity, Dorzinuuth was known for mounting daring campaigns and always returning with the same number of soldiers&#8212; and often alongside new recruits. In the wake of the death of Good King Omund, many were shocked to see Dorzinuuth debase himself with banditry and petty mercenary jobs. Others hold on to the hope that he makes unknown moves in darkness, waiting for the day when he can again uphold his oath in the light.</p>
						<h>Draconian Languages</h>
						<p>Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.</p>
						<h>Draconian Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any draconian's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:</p>

						<h>Thorn Dragon</h>
						<p>Thorn dragons take root in the destitution of nature, and are cultivated by the suffering of those who struggle against the cruelty of drought, fire, flood, and more. Though a region&#8217;s people might have long overcome past famine, the desperation of those who suffered long before has already nurtured their future scourge. These dragons appear born of the wood, resembling living thickets bedecked in torturous thorns. With twisting briar horns and wings shaped by tangled roots, thorn dragons embody the richness of nature they so readily leech the life from.</p>
						<h>Conquerors of the Green</h>
						<p>Thorn dragons cultivate their lairs in lush farmlands or flourishing forests. They engulf these beautiful regions in massive briar thickets, choking out existing flora until their own brambles are the only things that grow. In forests, this process drives out local fauna smart enough to flee rather than foolishly fight against the wood&#8217;s new ruler. When a thorn dragon establishes their lair over a village&#8217;s farmlands, local folk either wisely relocate or slowly starve for the sake of stubborn pride.</p>
						<h>Natural Curators</h>
						<p>More intelligent dragons seek all forms of riches for their hoard, but thorn dragons have no eye for worldly treasures. Instead, they amass the wealth of the wild they represent. Thorn dragons stockpile food&#8212; even food they won&#8217;t eat&#8212;alongside uncut gemstones, minerals and ore, wood, oils, and spices.</p>
						<h>Bestial Instincts</h>
						<p>Compared to more powerful dragons, thorn dragons are closer to beasts in temperament. They are incapable of speech and act primarily on instinct as they expand their territories, defend their lairs, and grow their hoards. Despite this, the folk of certain settlements manage to avoid being driven from their homes or starved at the expense of being dependent on a thorn dragon&#8217;s bestial ego. These farmers and woods folk come to a tenuous understanding with the dragon, trading them the kinds of treasure they desire in exchange for meager foodstuffs from the dragon&#8217;s hoard.</p>
						<h>Territorial Brutes</h>
						<p>Thorn dragons are highly territorial, and are vigilant against potential threats to their lairs. To defend their homes, these dragons take advantage of their thickets by dragonsealing intruders, pushing and pulling them across the briars, and letting the thorns bleed them dry. When mere brambles aren&#8217;t enough, thorn dragons either imbue those brambles&#8217; barbs with poison or breathe out those toxins directly, taking pleasure in slowly draining the life from their enemies.</p>
						<h>Thorn Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>Features At the start of a thorn dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Gloom Dragon</h>
						<p>Where twilight spills long and cold over the lands and chilling fog hangs heavy and wet through long autumns and winters, there you will find gloom dragons. Wreathed in churning shadows and wrapped in glittering dark scales, gloom dragons bring with them heavy fog and mist that manifests hallucinations, trapping their prey in nightmares.</p>
						<h>Thrill of the Hunt</h>
						<p>While many dragons command grand enclosed spaces, gloom dragons make their lairs within sprawling, murky wilds, commanding vast territories. As clever as ravens and as cunning as hunting beasts, they use mimicry and hallucinations to draw unsuspecting travelers ever farther into the mists of their domain, until the fog swallows the sound of those travelers&#8217; screams. In areas where gloom dragons settle, people are known to have more nightmares than usual.</p>
						<h>Intangible Treasures</h>
						<p>Gloom dragons are eerie collectors of voices, memories, and nightmares, as well as material items. Though able to speak, they can only repeat exactly what they&#8217;ve already heard, and so they prize their vast collections of voices and phrases, using these sounds to lure mortals close enough to draw out their memories and fears. Endlessly curious and fascinated by terror, gloom dragons are keen to see what hallucinations terrorize their prey before they slaughter them. When a gloom dragon slays a victim, they take not just their valuables, but also whatever is most meaningful to their fears. A broken mirror from a dead lover will always fascinate a gloom dragon more than a perfect ruby brooch.</p>
						<h>Unnerving Neighbors</h>
						<p>Instinct and curiosity drive these enshrouded hunters. It is rare to find a gloom dragon who can be reasoned with, but some might develop an understanding with nearby settlements, such that each leaves the other to their business. Since gloom dragons focus on individual terrorizing over mass destruction, it is relatively easy to coexist with one lurking in the swamps nearby. But in such cases, these dragons become the subject of stories told to children, warning them to never follow voices into the fog.</p>
						<h>Gloom Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>Eerie myths surround the gloom dragons, for they wield languages they do not themselves speak. These draconic nightmares can mimic any sound they&#8217;ve heard. But more mysteriously, the magic that produces their hallucinations also mimics the sounds a foe&#8217;s mind produces, no matter their language. If a hero hallucinates a loved one dying, everyone around will hear that loved one&#8217;s screams for help.</p>
						<h>Gloom Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a gloom dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Crucible Dragon</h>
						<p>Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief&#8212;often the result of failure in the pursuit of perfection. Each dragon is a dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate. These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on how fastidious they are about cleaning, and are occasionally gilded with more-precious metals. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.</p>
						<h>Bastions of Steel</h>
						<p>Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in peaks cut through with thick veins of iron ore. Occasionally, one will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle, the first thing a crucible dragon sets in place is a colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, slagging that iron in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but a dragon keeps a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers.</p>
						<h>Discerning Collectors</h>
						<p>Crucible dragons are obsessive collectors, and have a habit of narrowly focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, the Rain of Ten Thousand Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Vasloria. Joris&#8217;nyrathi, the Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge. All crucible dragons manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than for melting down as filigree or embossing the weapons and armor they forge.</p>
						<h>Flawed Pursuits</h>
						<p>The failure that spawned a crucible dragon drives their obsessive pursuits. They endlessly attempt to reproduce the perfect treasures they count among their most prized possessions, but can only recreate flawed copies at a fraction of their original power. Discarded projects, melted heaps of raw iron, and scrap angrily embedded into cavern walls perpetually surround a crucible dragon as examples of their failures, perpetuating a cycle of obsessive rage, grief, and inescapable decline.</p>
						<h>Crucible Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>The oldest of crucible dragons are known to speak some Vastariax, though younger dragons are typically silent. However, survivors of an encounter with a younger crucible dragon sometimes report the monster using the Caelian phrases &#8220;not enough&#8221; and &#8220;mine.&#8221;</p>
						<h>Crucible Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a crucible dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Omen Dragon</h>
						<p>They have been known by many names: Reaper, Blight, Sorrow, Stillness, Vengeance, Grief. The omen dragons carry as many meanings and interpretations as death itself&#8212;for they are death embodied. This dragon is a coalescing of wayward souls, the stench of death solidified, that clings to the last vestiges of this world&#8212;to the detriment of their surroundings.</p>
						<h>Life and Death</h>
						<p>The opposite of life isn&#8217;t death&#8212;it&#8217;s stagnation. When a soul refuses to move on, it lives outside the cycle of life. Souls can have any number of reasons to linger: anger, fear, sadness, a thirst for revenge. One skilled at dealing with the undead might even be able to shepherd such a soul back into its cycle. But when hundreds of souls with hundreds of unique motivations bind themselves to an elemental and form an omen dragon, the only practical way to stop them is to destroy what they&#8217;ve become. As the embodiment of these wayward souls, the omen dragon wields them like weapons. They can send restless souls to grab creatures and pull them in, or to possess their attackers, compelling them to distraction in the middle of a fight. They even wrap themselves in the most durable of souls, creating a stifling aura.</p>
						<h>Life Outside Life</h>
						<p>Just as the omen dragon exists outside the cycle of life, so too does their domain. The omen dragon&#8217;s dragonseal brings desolation and stagnancy to all living things. Growth does not happen. Living things that grow or creatures who dwell near an omen dragon&#8217;s domain do not age. One can often find secret societies researching lichdom residing in such sites, for what better place to study than a stagnant wasteland that grants one infinite time? The effects that surround an omen dragon also mean that new life cannot begin. Civilization cannot exist, let alone prosper, without a reliable food source. When living creatures die in these dragons&#8217; domains, their bodies do not decompose. Their souls are sucked into the omen dragon, granting the creature ever more power.</p>
						<h>Wicked Visions</h>
						<p>To face off against an omen dragon is to stare down death itself. One can spend only so long near a choir of restless souls before being compelled to sing. For the sin of defiance, this dragon bestows upon their attackers an omen of their own death. Tarry too long near the creature, and a hero risks fulfilling that prophecy, even if they can weather the dragon&#8217;s unrelenting attacks.</p>
						<h>Omen Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>An omen dragon speaks with the voices of all the souls they have collected. In addition to Vastariax, the dragon speaks and understands whatever languages those souls knew in life.</p>
						<h>Omen Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an omen dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>Meteor Dragon</h>
						<p>They dwell in the cold, airless depths of space in lair-cities built of stolen kingdoms for centuries at a time. Then without warning or mercy, a meteor dragon attacks.</p>
						<h>Kingdom Killers</h>
						<p>A meteor dragon&#8217;s territory is hard to define. Their attacks might come ages apart, and not every dead civilization or ruined city is the work of a dragon. But when a city grows too great, an empire too powerful, or a culture too advanced, the meteor dragon descends. Their violence isn&#8217;t mindless or wanton, but cold and calculated. Often, they breach dams, trigger landslides, and devastate granaries and fields, knowing that the chaos and devastation they unleash will continue long after they return to their lairs.</p>
						<h>Cities in the Sky</h>
						<p>Other dragons hoard trinkets and baubles. Meteor dragons claim their domain over infrastructure. Palaces, fortresses, monuments, and towers are often stolen by these creatures and brought back to their spacefaring lairs, arranged into dilapidated tableaus of the places they have obliterated. A meteor dragon&#8217;s floating lair-city is both their hoard and home, fused together and secured by the dragon&#8217;s glittering crystal dragonseal. Within this labyrinthine jumble of ruination, a meteor dragon lurks in wait for the next civilization to grow too comfortable.</p>
						<h>Avatar of the Infinite</h>
						<p>Meteor dragons have an innate mastery over gravitational forces that allows them to crush enemies and buildings on a whim. They&#8217;re among the smallest of the dragons, but the density of their bodies exudes an intense field of the cold, airless void of space around them wherever they go. A meteor dragon&#8217;s body is infused with crystalline starlight, which they can convert to a barrage of white-hot energy rays. At any distance, the dragon&#8217;s presence can forever sear the minds of lesser creatures.</p>
						<h>Voidlight Annihilation</h>
						<p>Voidlight is the name given to the unique energy produced by the breath of a meteor dragon. It is anathema to existence, an evil energy that destroys all. Anything that exists, no matter its material, strength, or potency, is inverted and ceases to exist when bathed in voidlight.</p>
						<h>Meteor Dragon Languages</h>
						<p>Meteor dragons are not known for their conversational habits. When they do deign to speak, it is exclusively in Vastariax and the First Language.</p>
						<h>Meteor Dragon Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a meteor dragon&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering.

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>DWARVES</h>
						<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone&#8212;a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves. They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is &#8220;Ord made the world.&#8221; Their way of saying, &#8220;What will be, will be.&#8221; Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord&#8217;s name.</p>
						<h>Tools of the Trade</h>
						<p>Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power. Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it&#8217;s a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.</p>
						<h>Innovative Operation</h>
						<p>The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors&#8217; greatest achievement, but they&#8217;ve made great strides in researching them. They&#8217;ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator. Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises. Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.</p>
						<h>The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar</h>
						<p>Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax&#8217;s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax&#8217;s favor. Most dwarves don&#8217;t like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work. The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.</p>
						<h>Servitor War Walkers</h>
						<p>The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they&#8217;re used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.</p>
						<h>Stone Whisperers</h>
						<p>Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy&#8217;s crushing defeat. Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today&#8217;s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Languages</h>
						<p>Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.</p>
						<h>Dwarf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any dwarf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELEMENTALS</h>
						<p>When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse&#8217;s most basic elements&#8212;air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.</p>
						<h>Duality of Form</h>
						<p>Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn&#8217;t suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew. Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.</p>
						<h>Rebirth and Reformation</h>
						<p>When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.</p>
						<h>Crux of Fire</h>
						<p>Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar&#8212;and if they don&#8217;t like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near. Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.</p>
						<h>Essence of Storms</h>
						<p>At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon. Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they&#8217;re usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.</p>
						<h>Essence of Tides</h>
						<p>An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters. Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship&#8212;but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.</p>
						<h>Field of Growth</h>
						<p>The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.</p>
						<h>Force of Earth</h>
						<p>A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.</p>
						<h>Elemental Languages</h>
						<p>Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.</p>
						<h>Elemental Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any elemental&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse&#8217;s most basic elements&#8212;air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.</p>
						<h>Duality of Form</h>
						<p>Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn&#8217;t suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew. Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.</p>
						<h>Rebirth and Reformation</h>
						<p>When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.</p>
						<h>Crux of Fire</h>
						<p>Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar&#8212;and if they don&#8217;t like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near. Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.</p>
						<h>Essence of Storms</h>
						<p>At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon. Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they&#8217;re usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.</p>
						<h>Essence of Tides</h>
						<p>An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters. Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship&#8212;but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.</p>
						<h>Field of Growth</h>
						<p>The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.</p>
						<h>Force of Earth</h>
						<p>A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.</p>
						<h>Elemental Languages</h>
						<p>Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.</p>
						<h>Elemental Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any elemental&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.</p>
						<h>High Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any high elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, HIGH</h>
						<p>The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>

						<h>ELVES, HIGH</h>
						<p>The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.</p>
						<h>High Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any high elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, HIGH</h>
						<p>The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.</p>
						<h>Glamorous</h>
						<p>The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one&#8217;s own values and fascinations.</p>
						<h>Loremasters</h>
						<p>The adage &#8220;knowledge is power&#8221; is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is &#8220;knowledge before power.&#8221; High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy. In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.</p>
						<h>Elemental Summoners</h>
						<p>Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.</p>
						<h>Surround and Suppress</h>
						<p>Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other&#8217;s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there&#8217;s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits&#8212;and eventually, graveyards.</p>
						<h>Magical Manipulation</h>
						<p>The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison. Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.</p>
						<h>The Unseen Hands</h>
						<p>The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.</p>
						<h>The Ordinator</h>
						<p>Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow&#8217;s tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.</p>
						<h>High Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.</p>
						<h>High Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any high elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, SHADOW</h>
						<p>Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.</p>
						<p>Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden&#8217;s topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all. In</p>
						<h>Equinox&#8217;s Shadow</h>
						<p>Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold&#8217;s eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.</p>
						<h>Manifold Weaponry</h>
						<p>The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.</p>
						<h>Brush Stalkers</h>
						<p>When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers&#8212;quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves. A brush stalker&#8217;s glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.</p>
						<h>Fractured Factions</h>
						<p>Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.</p>
						<h>Duskcalling</h>
						<p>Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.</p>
						<p>A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.</p>
						<h>Shadow Tactics</h>
						<p>Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they&#8217;ll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can&#8217;t benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.</p>
						<p>In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children&#8217;s game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.</p>
						<h>Shadow Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any shadow elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ELVES, WODE</h>
						<p>Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans should fear the trees.</p>
						<p>Wode elves&#8217; natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
						<h>Heart of the Wode</h>
						<p>The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode&#8217;s beating heart.</p>
						<h>Wodeworking</h>
						<p>Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg&#8217;s rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.</p>
						<p>Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.</p>
						<h>Sylvan Surveillance</h>
						<p>The wode elves&#8217; natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest&#8217;s goings-on while inside it. This isn&#8217;t a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf&#8217;s understanding of their surroundings.</p>
						<p>A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.</p>
						<h>Blightless Ambition</h>
						<p>Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home&#8217;s boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest&#8217;s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.</p>
						<h>Chirurgeons</h>
						<p>When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (kai-RUR-jinz) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.</p>
						<h>Warleader</h>
						<p>The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy&#8217;s movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader&#8217;s role is primarily that of teacher&#8212;a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.</p>
						<p>The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Languages</h>
						<p>Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.</p>
						<h>Wode Elf Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any wode elf&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>FOSSIL CRYPTIC</h>
						<p>The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought they were the fossilized reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers&#8217; priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren&#8217;t mindless undead&#8212;and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.</p>
						<h>Primal Sentries</h>
						<p>In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence, often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. Elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic&#8217;s domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the creature&#8217;s own form.</p>
						<h>Bones of the Earth</h>
						<p>Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling speed.</p>
						<h>Ancient Intelligence</h>
						<p>Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in ancient languages before attacking. Should trespassers persist, cryptics weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for battle.</p>
						<h>Fossil Cryptic Languages</h>
						<p>Many fossil cryptics speak Phorialtic, but they are known to also use the ancient languages of the ruins they inhabit.</p>
						<h>Fossil Cryptic Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a fossil cryptic&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GIANTS</h>
						<p>Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few &#8220;smallfolk&#8221; structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.</p>
						<h>Adaptable and Elemental</h>
						<p>Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn&#8217;t simply live on a glacial mountain&#8212;they&#8217;re part of that mountain, and it&#8217;s part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, &#8220;Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?&#8221;</p>
						<h>Distant Cousins</h>
						<p>Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don&#8217;t view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they&#8217;re willing to be in the vanguard.</p>
						<h>Fire Giants</h>
						<p>Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding. Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.</p>
						<h>Frost Giants</h>
						<p>Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory. Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.</p>
						<h>Hill Giants</h>
						<p>Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes. Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant&#8217;s ire, making them switch from one target to another.</p>
						<h>Stone Giants</h>
						<p>Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity. Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes&#8212;sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.</p>
						<h>Giant Languages</h>
						<p>Most giants speak their kind&#8217;s dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.</p>
						<h>Giant Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any giant&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GNOLLS</h>
						<p>Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll&#8217;s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack&#8217;s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.</p>
						<h>Born From Blood</h>
						<p>The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas&#8212;bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As&#8217;sylrak the Warper.</p>
						<p>As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends &#8220;gnoll,&#8221; an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is &#8220;to consume completely.&#8221; And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.</p>
						<h>Ceaseless Hunger</h>
						<p>The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn&#8217;t receive As&#8217;sylrak&#8217;s blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh&#8212;and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.</p>
						<h>Gnoll War</h>
						<p>Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren&#8217;t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.</p>
						<h>Abyssal Hyenas</h>
						<p>Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.</p>
						<h>Tusker Demons</h>
						<p>Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves&#8212;enemies and allies alike.</p>
						<h>Gnoll Languages</h>
						<p>Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac. .</p>
						<h>Gnoll Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any gnoll&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GOBLINS</h>
						<p>Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning &#8220;more of us&#8221; in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.</p>
						<p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society&#8212;thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.</p>
						<h>Encountered in Groups</h>
						<p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident&#8212;perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they&#8217;re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.</p>
						<h>Mobile and Sneaky</h>
						<p>Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies&#8217; knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.</p>
						<h>Goblin Magic</h>
						<p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.</p>
						<h>Skitterling</h>
						<p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>
						<h>War Spider</h>
						<p>Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal&#8217;s back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.</p>
						<h>Worg</h>
						<p>Some goblins form a special bond with worgs&#8212;canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.</p>
						<h>Goblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Goblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any goblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GOBLINS</h>
						<p>Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning &#8220;more of us&#8221; in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.</p>
						<p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society&#8212;thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.</p>
						<h>Encountered in Groups</h>
						<p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident&#8212;perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they&#8217;re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.</p>
						<h>Mobile and Sneaky</h>
						<p>Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies&#8217; knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.</p>
						<h>Goblin Magic</h>
						<p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.</p>
						<h>Skitterling</h>
						<p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>
						<h>War Spider</h>
						<p>Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal&#8217;s back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.</p>
						<h>Worg</h>
						<p>Some goblins form a special bond with worgs&#8212;canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.</p>
						<h>Goblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Goblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any goblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GOBLINS</h>
						<p>Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning &#8220;more of us&#8221; in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.</p>
						<p>Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society&#8212;thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.</p>
						<h>Encountered in Groups</h>
						<p>Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident&#8212;perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they&#8217;re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.</p>
						<h>Mobile and Sneaky</h>
						<p>Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies&#8217; knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.</p>
						<h>Goblin Magic</h>
						<p>Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.</p>
						<h>Skitterling</h>
						<p>A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.</p>
						<h>War Spider</h>
						<p>Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal&#8217;s back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.</p>
						<h>Worg</h>
						<p>Some goblins form a special bond with worgs&#8212;canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.</p>
						<h>Goblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Goblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any goblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>GRIFFONS</h>
						<p>With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, griffons are the apex predator&#8217;s apex predator. Highly territorial with ranges spanning hundreds of leagues, these air-superiority hunters make quick work of any humanoids foolish enough to stumble into griffon lands.</p>
						<h>Coveted Mounts</h>
						<p>Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.</p>
						<p>Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.</p>
						<h>Inaccessible Aeries</h>
						<p>Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can&#8217;t fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for three months starting in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then remain in or near the nest as their parents feed them. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly&#8212;and after that, it&#8217;s only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.</p>
						<h>Rare Breeds</h>
						<p>Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety, a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety, and a striped condor griffon that combines the features of condor and tiger. Questions abound as to whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands, and many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can bring them evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.</p>

						<h>HAG</h>
						<p>When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal spellcaster, often a druid or a witch, they might forge a pact with an evil archfey. The mortal becomes a hag&#8212;aged, clawed, and cruel. A ruthlessly powerful fey in their own right, a hag uses their magic to bring about the misery their archfey wills.</p>
						<h>Hiding in Plain Sight</h>
						<p>Though hags typically appear as older humanoids, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. This theory has never been confirmed, however, as few who see a hag&#8217;s true form live to tell the tale.</p>
						<h>Dealmakers and Heartbreakers</h>
						<p>As old age can&#8217;t kill them, the oldest hags accumulate swathes of knowledge, magic, and repute over time. They are happy to share their wares &#8230; for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer&#8212;perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child&#8217;s laugh, or their left pinky toe.</p>
						<p>Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, with some getting so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.</p>
						<h>What&#8217;s in a Name?</h>
						<p>Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers such as Auntie, Uncle, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Uncle Twothumbs?</p>
						<h>Loyal Underlings</h>
						<p>Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they can trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.</p>
						<h>Hag Languages</h>
						<p>Most hags speak Anjali, Caelian, Khelt, and Yllyric, with older hags often knowing several more languages.</p>
						<h>Hag Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a hag&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>
						<h>Slaughter Demon</h>
						<p>When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack&#8217;tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.</p>
						<p>Devils captured the grack&#8217;tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any hobgoblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>
						<h>Slaughter Demon</h>
						<p>When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack&#8217;tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.</p>
						<p>Devils captured the grack&#8217;tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any hobgoblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>
						<h>Slaughter Demon</h>
						<p>When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack&#8217;tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.</p>
						<p>Devils captured the grack&#8217;tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Languages</h>
						<p>Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.</p>
						<h>Hobgoblin Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any hobgoblin&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries.

						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>

						<h>HOBGOBLINS</h>
						<p>Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.</p>
						<p>Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other&#8217;s boundaries. This isn&#8217;t normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it&#8217;s time to take over everyone else&#8217;s lands&#8212;THEN it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
						<h>Synergized Tactics</h>
						<p>Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.</p>
						<h>Playing With Fire</h>
						<p>The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can&#8217;t tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.</p>
						<h>Innate Magic</h>
						<p>Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.</p>
						<h>Binding Bargains</h>
						<p>Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature&#8212;hobgoblin or otherwise&#8212;who degrades themself by breaking their word.</p>
						<h>Grilp</h>
						<p>The grilp&#8212;a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat&#8212;can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp&#8217;s covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.</p>

						<h>HUMANS</h>
						<p>Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.</p>
						<h>Villains and Heroes</h>
						<p>Recognizing their limited lifespans, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes that their names will be remembered forever.</p>
						<p>Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more with might or magic. Others turn to theft, sometimes driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons both seeking to exact a toll.</p>
						<p>Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek fell power in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Human heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.</p>
						<h>Risks and Rewards</h>
						<p>Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive nature explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment&#8212;knowing when to risk all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent&#8217;s mistakes and seize the advantage.</p>
						<p>Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village, or an ancient dungeon yielding chests filled with coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it&#8217;s a game worth playing.</p>
						<h>Swords for Hire</h>
						<p>With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally &#8230; if you can afford their price.</p>
						<h>Connected to the Natural World</h>
						<p>Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that many other folk are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena have been created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural effects.</p>
						<h>Human Languages</h>
						<p>Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
						<h>Human Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any human&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>HUMANS</h>
						<p>Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.</p>
						<h>Villains and Heroes</h>
						<p>Recognizing their limited lifespans, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes that their names will be remembered forever.</p>
						<p>Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more with might or magic. Others turn to theft, sometimes driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons both seeking to exact a toll.</p>
						<p>Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek fell power in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Human heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.</p>
						<h>Risks and Rewards</h>
						<p>Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive nature explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment&#8212;knowing when to risk all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent&#8217;s mistakes and seize the advantage.</p>
						<p>Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village, or an ancient dungeon yielding chests filled with coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it&#8217;s a game worth playing.</p>
						<h>Swords for Hire</h>
						<p>With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally &#8230; if you can afford their price.</p>
						<h>Connected to the Natural World</h>
						<p>Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that many other folk are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena have been created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural effects.</p>
						<h>Human Languages</h>
						<p>Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.</p>
						<h>Human Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any human&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KINGFISSURE WORM </h>
						<p>Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth. For when a worm senses the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their multiple serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into their cavernous maw. </p>
						<h>Intestine Inventory </h>
						<p>The kingfissure worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon&#8217;s hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have managed to claim the treasure lost to the inside of a kingfissure worm, but stories enough have spread to draw scavengers, bandits, and even armies to the corpses of recently slain worms, all hoping to come away with a king&#8217;s ransom in spoils. </p>
						<h>Home Renovators </h>
						<p>Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in that lair for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren&#8217;t disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food&#8212;occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm&#8217;s underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages. </p>
						<h>Unstoppable Force </h>
						<p>The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature. Though the monster might be slowed by a display of great power, only death stops them. Once they have set their sights on their prey, they single-mindedly pursue it regardless of terrain or circumstance. The only thing that gives a kingfissure worm pause are attacks on their tongues, which are left vulnerable when they are dragging creatures to their impending doom. </p>
						<h>Unclear Origins </h>
						<p>Kingfissure worms have no identifiable sexual characteristics and are extremely territorial. If two kingfissure worms encounter each other, the result is always a cataclysmic duel that ends in one devouring the other. Because of this, most scholars theorize that these creatures reproduce asexually&#8212;and that when a kingfissure worm dies, their tongues detach and grow into full-fledged worms. While this has yet to be confirmed, juvenile kingfissure worms have been seen in the wild, most often spotted following animal herds or traveling communities, feeding off of stragglers, refuse, remains, and vermin. </p>
						<h>Swallowed Survivors </h>
						<p>Kingfissure worms never stop growing, and the oldest are truly immense, easily mistaken in the distance for a strangely mobile mountain range. Deep within the bowels of these behemoths, unusual biomes and oversized gut fauna may flourish. In fact, some people who have survived their trip down the gargantuan gullet of one of the great worms have been able to eke out a life&#8212;and even form thriving communities&#8212;safe inside the spacious lower abdomen of their living quarters. </p>
						<h>Sensitive Giant </h>
						<p>For all their might and vitality, kingfissure worms are primarily ambush hunters, and like any ambush hunter, they need delicate and precise senses to detect and target their prey when it approaches. As burrowing creatures, they have a finely tuned sense of touch able to detect even the most minute vibrations while in direct contact with earth and stone. This fills the role of their primary sense, and their rudimentary eyesight leaves them dreadfully nearsighted. In combination, their poor vision and reliance on ground-conducted vibrations means that they have almost no way of pinpointing flying creatures, and many species of birds find kingfissure worm territory exceptionally safe and free from predators. </p>
						<h>Kingfissure Worm Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a kingfissure worm&#8217;s turn or when an action&#8217;s trigger occurs, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS </h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat. </p>
						<h>Defensive Masters </h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds. </p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before. </p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics </h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section). </p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons </h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations. </p>
						<h>Domain Expansion </h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory. </p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery </h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards. </p>
						<h>Cute Pets </h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side. </p>
						<h>Kobold Languages </h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian. </p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>KOBOLDS</h>
						<p>Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.</p>
						<h>Defensive Masters</h>
						<p>In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold&#8217;s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.</p>
						<p>Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.</p>
						<h>Unconventional Tactics</h>
						<p>Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn&#8217;t take them seriously. Their foes haven&#8217;t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).</p>
						<h>Tiny Dragons</h>
						<p>Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons&#8212;and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon&#8217;s scales over several generations.</p>
						<h>Domain Expansion</h>
						<p>When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon&#8217;s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon&#8217;s hold on the territory.</p>
						<h>Terrain Mastery</h>
						<p>The kobolds&#8217; affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature&#8217;s traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don&#8217;t give chase. They likely know something you don&#8217;t about these terrain hazards.</p>
						<h>Cute Pets</h>
						<p>The gummy brick is a deadly ooze&#8212;a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins&#8212;draconic pangolins&#8212;who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.</p>
						<h>Kobold Languages</h>
						<p>Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.</p>
						<h>Kobold Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any kobolds&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>Lightbenders can also bend the sounds they make, enabling them to almost completely disappear during a hunt.

						<p>Lizardfolk aren&#8217;t especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened&#8212;which it often is.

Lizardfolk cultures often focus on a specific trade, such as boat building, fletching, navigating, or weaving, and sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places. </p>
						<p>Adventurers often cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in abandoned ruins and caverns for protection. Treasure seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins. </p>
						<h>Focused and Loyal </h>
						<p>Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth. </p>
						<h>Marshland Tyrants </h>
						<p>In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing, and they often seek the aid of other folk who value freedom from tyranny. </p>

						<p>In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory.

						<h>MANTICORE </h>
						<p>A weary traveler hears a call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge&#8212;only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisonous spikes. In a manticore&#8217;s territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. Though manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh. </p>
						<h>Uncanny Appearances </h>
						<p>A manticore has a lion&#8217;s body, a dragon&#8217;s wings, and a scorpion&#8217;s tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common ancestries that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by devils inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they&#8217;ve heard&#8212;a talent manticores use to lure in prey. </p>
						<h>Heralds of Death </h>
						<p>Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet blast. This haunting sound unnerves and terrifies creatures, making them more susceptible to the manticore&#8217;s bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in. </p>
						<h>Ferocious Companions </h>
						<p>A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. Even after a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver. </p>
						<h>Manticore Languages </h>
						<p>Most manticores can mimic Caelian and one language commonly spoken in the region where they dwell. Except in rare cases, manticores don&#8217;t communicate in full sentences and are too driven by hunger to engage in negotiation. </p>
						<h>Manticore Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any manticore&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>MEDUSA </h>
						<p>Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, medusas are some of the most underestimated and misunderstood creatures. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god. But while some medusas embrace wickedness, many simply fight for their lives against those who threaten them through their ignorance. </p>
						<h>Cursed for Defiance </h>
						<p>When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, agents of that deity might curse them to live as a medusa. The offender&#8217;s skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone. </p>
						<p>Followers of the gods who imposes this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude, or to places haunted by creatures who don&#8217;t judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories. Many medusas plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of the aggressors who foolishly hunted or harmed them. </p>
						<h>Serpentine Reflexes </h>
						<p>While the medusa&#8217;s stone gaze is legendary, they can move, strike, and evade as swiftly as a snake, even briefly manifesting scaled wings to dart through the chaos. This enhanced dexterity makes them difficult to pin down. Their petrifying gaze allows them to attack at range as necessary, but they&#8217;re equally deadly in melee, where they have the full advantage of their snakes and the enervating venom pulsing through each snake&#8217;s set of needlelike fangs. </p>
						<h>Baleful Magic </h>
						<p>Medusas have many means to defend themselves, even aside from their petrifying stare. They slow enemies down, weaken them, and can even temporarily charm and control them once petrifying magic takes root in their veins. These reclusive beings are no stranger to being outnumbered and overwhelmed. All they have in their power to gain leverage over their opponents, they wield ruthlessly. </p>
						<h>Stone Gardens </h>
						<p>Medusas often reside in stone gardens filled with statues of those who previously tried to slay them. This not only allows them to slip between their statues, hide, and then strike, but it also allows them to command the battle while in their lairs, shattering statues to harm others. Evil medusas sometimes slowly reverse the petrification of their victims one limb at a time to feed on them, creating grotesque mausoleums of the crumbling dead for unwitting adventurers to wander into. </p>
						<h>Lifting the Curse </h>
						<p>Agents of the deity who ordered a medusa&#8217;s curse can sometimes be convinced to lift the punishment, usually in response to the medusa undertaking an impossible task in the god&#8217;s name or making a threat that can&#8217;t be ignored. Some sages claim that ancient rituals can undo the curse, but these lost secrets are often hidden by wrathful divine servants&#8212;and performing such a ritual might entail great sacrifice. </p>
						<h>Medusa Languages </h>
						<p>Medusas can speak any language they knew before they were cursed. Many of them speak Caelian, and others have learned the languages of monsters and creatures they dwell near. Additionally, tales tell of some medusas who speak the original form of Khamish. </p>
						<h>Medusa Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of a medusa&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>MINOTAURS </h>
						<p>The fearsome minotaur is a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity. </p>
						<h>Primal Rage </h>
						<p>Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it. Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is impossible. </p>
						<h>Labyrinthine Origins </h>
						<p>The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia&#8217;s mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia&#8217;s anger&#8212;until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love. </p>
						<p>New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other labyrinthine terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, small numbers of minotaurs can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement. </p>
						<h>Deep Bonds </h>
						<p>Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature&#8217;s ire&#8212;but gods help them if they betray the minotaur. </p>
						<h>Minotaur Languages </h>
						<p>Most minotaurs speak their own dialect of Khamish.</p>
						<h>Minotaur Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any minotaur&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>MINOTAURS</h>
						<p>The fearsome minotaur is a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity.</p>
						<h>Primal Rage</h>
						<p>Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it. Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is impossible.</p>
						<h>Labyrinthine Origins</h>
						<p>The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia&#8217;s mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia&#8217;s anger&#8212;until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love.</p>
						<p>New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other labyrinthine terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, small numbers of minotaurs can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.</p>
						<h>Deep Bonds</h>
						<p>Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature&#8217;s ire&#8212;but gods help them if they betray the minotaur.</p>
						<h>Minotaur Languages</h>
						<p>Most minotaurs speak their own dialect of Khamish.</p>
						<h>Minotaur Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any minotaur&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>OGRES </h>
						<p>Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life. </p>
						<h>Extreme Emotions </h>
						<p>Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart&#8217;s desire, be it food, riches, or friendship. </p>
						<p>Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place. </p>
						<h>Savory Stories </h>
						<p>Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain&#8212;from deceptive mages to talking cats&#8212;swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences. </p>
						<h>Aristocracy of Bullies </h>
						<p>When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats&#8212;but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends. </p>
						<h>Cyclops: Ogre Progenitor </h>
						<p>Ogres originally descended from the cyclops, an old-world giant with a single eye whose kind still roam through remote canyons and valleys. These behemoths stand heads above the ogres and are twice as destructive once they&#8217;ve spotted their prey. But while their binocular cousins have gone on to become successful hunters and live for themselves, the cyclops is a scavenger hindered by their poor eyesight. Most cyclopses are eager to work for and defend powerful warlords or wealthy ogres, as long as they have easy access to food and shelter. </p>
						<p>Rumor has it that a cyclops can emit a mile-long energy ray from their eye. However, focusing such power is nearly impossible when their vision is usually too irritated and clouded by dirt. </p>

						<h>OGRES</h>
						<p>Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.</p>
						<h>Extreme Emotions</h>
						<p>Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart&#8217;s desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.</p>
						<p>Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.</p>
						<h>Savory Stories</h>
						<p>Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain&#8212;from deceptive mages to talking cats&#8212;swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs.

						<h>OLOTHEC </h>
						<p>Protean in form, beings of nearly pure intellect, the Old Ones think in alien geometric logic. Their name for themselves is unrecorded, but sages believe they are the oldest beings in the timescape and simply call them &#8220;The Old Ones.&#8221; Synlirii refer to them as olothec (OH- luhthek)&#8212;&#8220; ancient enemies.&#8221; But some humanoid scholars have noted this term bears an uncanny similarity to another archaic synlirii word meaning &#8220;ancient ancestor.&#8221; </p>
						<h>Immortal Evil </h>
						<p>Across countless cultures and ancestries, olothec feature in nightmares and temple friezes alike. While their origins are obscure and may never be known, their hatred of the mundane world and every living thing in it is well recorded. Olothec channel psionic energy beyond any mortal power, surpassing even the voiceless talkers. To them, a living creature who can&#8217;t reshape their own flesh is repugnant, an unnatural abomination requiring eradication&#8212;or transformation. </p>
						<h>Agents of Chaos </h>
						<p>Olothec consider the primordial chaos that spawned them as the ideal state of existence. They have long warred against the voiceless talkers, loathing their constant manipulation and refinement of evolutionary forces. Where olothec lair in forgotten sea tunnels and beneath ancient ruins, they surround themselves with slime servants&#8212;humanoids, beasts, horrors, and others, all devolved to a perfect physical and mental state. </p>
						<h>Primordial Form </h>
						<p>At first sight, an olothec seems like little more than a rippling mass of tentacles, twisting around each other like a shifting shroud. Creatures who get too close discover each of those tentacles ends in a ravenous mouth set with razor-sharp teeth. Each mouth is tipped by a cluster of three eyes that focus the olothec&#8217;s relentless attacks. In water or on land, fetid slime coats the horror, protecting them against attackers and acting as a conduit for their fearsome psionic power. </p>
						<h>Mutations of the Flesh </h>
						<p>Millennia of practice have allowed olothec to perfect psionic abilities that devolve and transform their victims into primordial life forms. Exposure to the psionic slime of an olothec&#8217;s tentacles can change a creature into a mindless, oozing thrall. The most powerful olothec have unique powers that further warp flesh. </p>
						<h>Olothec Languages </h>
						<p>Most olothec communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Urollialic. Many also know Old Variac and Caelian, but converse in those languages only when necessary. </p>
						<h>Olothec Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of an olothec&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS </h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk. </p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings. </p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough </h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth. </p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively. </p>
						<h>Innate Power </h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit. </p>
						<h>Mohlers </h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet. </p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party. </p>
						<h>Scyzas </h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound. </p>
						<h>Orc Languages </h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak. </p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

						<h>ORCS</h>
						<p>In a long-lost language, the word oruk&#8212;&#8220;blood fire&#8221;&#8212;described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin (&#8220;the people&#8221;) in their own language, they also use &#8220;orc&#8221; with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.</p>
						<p>Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They&#8217;ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers&#8217; than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.</p>
						<h>Relentlessly Tough</h>
						<p>Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they&#8217;re excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.</p>
						<p>Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with &#8220;blood fire,&#8221; glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.</p>
						<h>Innate Power</h>
						<p>The intense power of an orc&#8217;s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature&#8217;s spirit.</p>
						<h>Mohlers</h>
						<p>Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests&#8212;and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs&#8217; enemies off their feet.</p>
						<p>When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.</p>
						<h>Scyzas</h>
						<p>Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza&#8217;s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.</p>
						<h>Orc Languages</h>
						<p>Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.</p>
						<h>Orc Malice</h>
						<p>At the start of any orc&#8217;s turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.</p>

At the start of each round, the swarm moves 1 square and its size increases by 1 square (to 2 squares by 2 squares, 3 squares by 3 squares, and so forth), preferring squares in a creature’s space. After 3 rounds, the swarm dissipates.</traits_name2>
